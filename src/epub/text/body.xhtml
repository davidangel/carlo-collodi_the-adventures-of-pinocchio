     <h2>THE PIECE OF WOOD THAT LAUGHED
          AND CRIED LIKE A CHILD</h2>


     <p>There was once upon a time a piece of wood in the
          shop of an old carpenter named Master Antonio. Everybody,
          however, called him Master Cherry, on account of the
          end of his nose, which was always as red and polished as a
          ripe cherry.</p>

     <p>No sooner had Master Cherry set eyes on the piece of
          wood than his face beamed with delight, and, rubbing his
          hands together with satisfaction, he said softly to himself:</p>

     <p>"This wood has come at the right moment; it will just
          do to make the leg of a little table."</p>

     <p>He immediately took a sharp axe with which to remove
          the bark and the rough surface, but just as he was going
          to give the first stroke he heard a very small voice say
          imploringly, "Do not strike me so hard!"</p>

     <p>He turned his terrified eyes all around the room to try
          and discover where the little voice could possibly have come
          from, but he saw nobody! He looked under the bench&mdash;nobody;
          he looked into a cupboard that was always shut&mdash;nobody;
          he looked into a basket of shavings and sawdust&mdash;nobody;
          he even opened the door of the shop and gave a glance into
          the street&mdash;and still nobody. Who, then, could it be?</p>

     <p>"I see how it is," he said, laughing and scratching his
          wig, "evidently that little voice was all my imagination. Let
          us set to work again."</p>

     <p>And, taking up the axe, he struck a tremendous blow on
          the piece of wood.</p>

     <p>"Oh! oh! you have hurt me!" cried the same little voice
          dolefully.</p>

     <p>This time Master Cherry was petrified. His eyes started
          out of his head with fright, his mouth remained open, and
          his tongue hung out almost to the end of his chin, like a
          mask on a fountain. As soon as he had recovered the use
          of his speech he began to say, stuttering and trembling
          with fear:</p>

     <p>"But where on earth can that little voice have come
          from that said 'Oh! oh!'? Is it possible that this piece of
          wood can have learned to cry and to lament like a child?
          I cannot believe it. This piece of wood is nothing but a log
          for fuel like all the others, and thrown on the fire it would
          about suffice to boil a saucepan of beans. How then? Can
          anyone be hidden inside it? If anyone is hidden inside, so
          much the worse for him. I will settle him at once."</p>

     <p>So saying, he seized the poor piece of wood and commenced
          beating it without mercy against the walls of the room.</p>

     <p>Then he stopped to listen if he could hear any little
          voice lamenting. He waited two minutes&mdash;nothing; five minutes&mdash;nothing;
          ten minutes&mdash;still nothing!</p>

     <p>"I see how it is," he then said, forcing himself to laugh,
          and pushing up his wig; "evidently the little voice that said
          'Oh! oh!' was all my imagination! Let us set to work again."</p>

     <p>Putting the axe aside, he took his plane, to plane and
          polish the bit of wood; but whilst he was running it up and
          down he heard the same little voice say, laughing:</p>

     <p>"Stop! you are tickling me all over!"</p>

     <p>This time poor Master Cherry fell down as if he had
          been struck by lightning. When he at last opened his eyes
          he found himself seated on the floor.</p>

     <p>His face was changed, even the end of his nose, instead
          of being crimson, as it was nearly always, had become blue
          from fright.</p>

     <h2>MASTER CHERRY GIVES THE WOOD AWAY</h2>


     <p>At that moment some one knocked at the door.</p>

     <p>"Come in," said the carpenter, without having the
          strength to rise to his feet.</p>

     <p>A lively little old man immediately walked into the shop.
          His name was Geppetto, but when the boys of the neighborhood
          wished to make him angry they called him Pudding,
          because his yellow wig greatly resembled a pudding made of
          Indian corn.</p>

     <p>Geppetto was very fiery. Woe to him who called him
          Pudding! He became furious and there was no holding him.</p>

     <p>"Good-day, Master Antonio," said Geppetto; "what are
          you doing there on the floor?"</p>

     <p>"I am teaching the alphabet to the ants."</p>

     <p>"Much good may that do you."</p>

     <p>"What has brought you to me, neighbor Geppetto?"</p>

     <p>"My legs. But to tell the truth. Master Antonio, I came
          to ask a favor of you."</p>

     <p>"Here I am, ready to serve you," replied the carpenter,
          getting on his knees.</p>

     <p>"This morning an idea came into my head."</p>

     <p>"Let us hear it."</p>

     <p>"I thought I would make a beautiful wooden puppet;
          one that could dance, fence, and leap like an acrobat. With
          this puppet I would travel about the world to earn a piece
          of bread and a glass of wine. What do you think of it?"</p>

     <p>"Bravo, Pudding!" exclaimed the same little voice, and
          it was impossible to say where it came from.</p>

     <p>Hearing himself called Pudding, Geppetto became as red
          as a turkey-cock from rage and, turning to the carpenter, he
          said in a fury:</p>

     <p>"Why do you insult me?"</p>

     <p>"Who insults you?"</p>

     <p>"You called me Pudding!"</p>

     <p>"It was not I!"</p>

     <p>"Do you think I called myself Pudding? It was you,
          I say!"</p>

     <p>"No!"</p>

     <p>"Yes!"</p>

     <p>"No!"</p>

     <p>"Yes!"</p>

     <p>And, becoming more and more angry, from words they
          came to blows, and, flying at each other, they bit and fought,
          and scratched.</p>

     <p>When the fight was over Master Antonio was in possession
          of Geppetto's yellow wig, and Geppetto discovered that
          the grey wig belonging to the carpenter remained between
          his teeth.</p>

     <p>"Give me back my wig," screamed Master Antonio.</p>

     <p>"And you, return me mine, and let us be friends again."</p>

     <p>The two old men having each recovered his own wig,
          shook hands and swore that they would remain friends to the
          end of their lives.</p>

     <p>"Well, then, neighbor Geppetto," said the carpenter, to
          prove that peace was made, "what is the favor that you wish
          of me?"</p>

     <p>"I want a little wood to make my puppet; will you give
          me some?"</p>

     <p>Master Antonio was delighted, and he immediately went
          to the bench and fetched the piece of wood that had caused
          him so much fear. But just as he was going to give it to
          his friend the piece of wood gave a shake and, wriggling
          violently out of his hands, struck with all of its force against
          the dried-up shins of poor Geppetto.</p>

     <p>"Ah! is that the courteous way in which you make your
          presents, Master Antonio? You have almost lamed me!"</p>

     <p>"I swear to you that it was not I!"</p>

     <p>"Then you would have it that it was I?"</p>

     <p>"The wood is entirely to blame!"</p>

     <p>"I know that it was the wood; but it was you that hit
          my legs with it!"</p>

     <p>"I did not hit you with it!"</p>

     <p>"Liar!"</p>

     <p>"Geppetto, don't insult me or I will call you Pudding!"</p>

     <p>"Knave!"</p>

     <p>"Pudding!"</p>

     <p>"Donkey!"</p>

     <p>"Pudding!"</p>

     <p>"Baboon!"</p>

     <p>"Pudding!"</p>

     <p>On hearing himself called Pudding for the third time
          Geppetto, mad with rage, fell upon the carpenter and they
          fought desperately.</p>

     <p>When the battle was over, Master Antonio had two more
          scratches on his nose, and his adversary had lost two buttons
          off his waistcoat. Their accounts being thus squared, they
          shook hands and swore to remain good friends for the rest
          of their lives.</p>

     <p>Geppetto carried off his fine piece of wood and, thanking
          Master Antonio, returned limping to his house.</p>

     <h2>GEPPETTO NAMES HIS PUPPET PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>Geppetto lived in a small ground-floor room that was
          only lighted from the staircase. The furniture could not
          have been simpler&mdash;a rickety chair, a poor bed, and a broken-down
          table. At the end of the room there was a fireplace
          with a lighted fire; but the fire was painted, and by the fire
          was a painted saucepan that was boiling cheerfully and sending
          out a cloud of smoke that looked exactly like real smoke.</p>

     <p>As soon as he reached home Geppetto took his tools and
          set to work to cut out and model his puppet.</p>

     <p>"What name shall I give him?" he said to himself; "I
          think I will call him Pinocchio. It is a name that will bring
          him luck. I once knew a whole family so called. There was
          Pinocchio the father, Pinocchia the mother, and Pinocchi the
          children, and all of them did well. The richest of them was
          a beggar."</p>

     </div>


     <p>Having found a name for his puppet he began to work
          in good earnest, and he first made his hair, then his forehead,
          and then his eyes.</p>

     <p>The eyes being finished, imagine his astonishment when
          he perceived that they moved and looked fixedly at him.</p>

     <p>Geppetto, seeing himself stared at by those two wooden
          eyes, said in an angry voice:</p>

     <p>"Wicked wooden eyes, why do you look at me?"</p>

     <p>No one answered.</p>

     <p>He then proceeded to carve the nose, but no sooner had
          he made it than it began to grow. And it grew, and grew,
          and grew, until in a few minutes it had become an immense
          nose that seemed as if it would never end.</p>

     <p>Poor Geppetto tired himself out with cutting it off, but
          the more he cut and shortened it, the longer did that impertinent
          nose become!</p>

     <p>The mouth was not even completed when it began to laugh
          and deride him.</p>

     <p>"Stop laughing!" said Geppetto, provoked; but he might
          as well have spoken to the wall.</p>

     <p>"Stop laughing, I say!" he roared in a threatening tone.</p>

     <p>The mouth then ceased laughing, but put out its tongue
          as far as it would go.</p>

     <p>Geppetto, not to spoil his handiwork, pretended not to
          see and continued his labors. After the mouth he fashioned
          the chin, then the throat, then the shoulders, the stomach,
          the arms and the hands.</p>

     <p>The hands were scarcely finished when Geppetto felt his
          wig snatched from his head. He turned round, and what
          did he see? He saw his yellow wig in the puppet's hand.</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio! Give me back my wig instantly!"</p>

     <p>But Pinocchio, instead of returning it, put it on his own
          head and was in consequence nearly smothered.</p>

     <p>Geppetto at this insolent and derisive behavior felt sadder
          and more melancholy than he had ever been in his life before;
          and, turning to Pinocchio, he said to him:</p>

     <p>"You young rascal! You are not yet completed and you
          are already beginning to show want of respect to your father!
          That is bad, my boy, very bad!"</p>

     <p>And he dried a tear.</p>

     <p>The legs and the feet remained to be done.</p>

     <p>When Geppetto had finished the feet he received a kick
          on the point of his nose.</p>

     <p>"I deserve it!" he said to himself; "I should have thought
          of it sooner! Now it is too late!"</p>

     <p>He then took the puppet under the arms and placed
          him on the floor to teach him to walk.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio's legs were stiff and he could not move, but
          Geppetto led him by the hand and showed him how to put
          one foot before the other.</p>

     <p>When his legs became limber Pinocchio began to walk
          by himself and to run about the room, until, having gone out
          of the house door, he jumped into the street and escaped.</p>

     <p>Poor Geppetto rushed after him but was not able to overtake
          him, for that rascal Pinocchio leaped in front of him
          like a hare and knocking his wooden feet together against the
          pavement made as much clatter as twenty pairs of peasants'
          clogs.</p>

     <p>"Stop him! stop him!" shouted Geppetto; but the people
          in the street, seeing a wooden puppet running like a race-horse,
          stood still in astonishment to look at it, and laughed
          and laughed.</p>

     <p>At last, as good luck would have it, a soldier arrived who,
          hearing the uproar, imagined that a colt had escaped from
          his master. Planting himself courageously with his legs apart
          in the middle of the road, he waited with the determined purpose
          of stopping him and thus preventing the chance of worse
          disasters.</p>

     <p>When Pinocchio, still at some distance, saw the soldier
          barricading the whole street, he endeavored to take him by
          surprise and to pass between his legs. But he failed entirely.</p>

     <p>The soldier without disturbing himself in the least caught
          him cleverly by the nose and gave him to Geppetto. Wishing
          to punish him, Geppetto intended to pull his ears at once.
          But imagine his feelings when he could not succeed in finding
          them. And do you know the reason? In his hurry to model
          him he had forgotten to make any ears.</p>

     <p>He then took him by the collar and as he was leading
          him away he said to him, shaking his head threateningly:</p>

     <p>"We will go home at once, and as soon as we arrive
          we will settle our accounts, never doubt it."</p>

     <p>At this information Pinocchio threw himself on the ground
          and would not take another step. In the meanwhile a crowd
          of idlers and inquisitive people began to assemble and to make
          a ring around them.</p>

     <p>Some of them said one thing, some another.</p>

     <p>"Poor puppet!" said several, "he is right not to wish
          to return home! Who knows how Geppetto, that bad old
          man, will beat him!"</p>

     <p>And the others added maliciously:</p>

     <p>"Geppetto seems a good man! but with boys he is a
          regular tyrant! If that poor puppet is left in his hands he
          is quite capable of tearing him in pieces!"</p>

     <p>It ended in so much being said and done that the soldier
          at last set Pinocchio at liberty and led Geppetto to prison.
          The poor man, not being ready with words to defend himself,
          cried like a calf and as he was being led away to prison
          sobbed out:</p>

     <p>"Wretched boy! And to think how I labored to make
          him a well-conducted puppet! But it serves me right! I should
          have thought of it sooner!"</p>

     <h2>THE TALKING-CRICKET SCOLDS PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>While poor Geppetto was being taken to prison for no
          fault of his, that imp Pinocchio, finding himself free
          from the clutches of the soldier, ran off as fast as his legs
          could carry him. That he might reach home the quicker he
          rushed across the fields, and in his mad hurry he jumped
          high banks, thorn hedges and ditches full of water.</p>

     <p>Arriving at the house he found the street door ajar. He
          pushed it open, went in, and having fastened the latch, threw
          himself on the floor and gave a great sigh of satisfaction.</p>

     <p>But soon he heard some one in the room who was saying:</p>

     <p>"Cri-cri-cri!"</p>

     <p>"Who calls me?" said Pinocchio in a fright.</p>

     <p>"It is I!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio turned round and saw a big cricket crawling
          slowly up the wall.</p>

     <p>"Tell me, Cricket, who may you be?"</p>

     <p>"I am the Talking-Cricket, and I have lived in this room
          a hundred years or more."</p>

     <p>"Now, however, this room is mine," said the puppet, "and
          if you would do me a pleasure go away at once, without even
          turning round."</p>

     <p>"I will not go," answered the Cricket, "until I have told
          you a great truth."</p>

     <p>"Tell it me, then, and be quick about it."</p>

     <p>"Woe to those boys who rebel against their parents and
          run away from home. They will never come to any good
          in the world, and sooner or later they will repent bitterly."</p>

     <p>"Sing away, Cricket, as you please, and as long as you
          please. For me, I have made up my mind to run away
          tomorrow at daybreak, because if I remain I shall not escape
          the fate of all other boys; I shall be sent to school and shall
          be made to study either by love or by force. To tell you in
          confidence, I have no wish to learn; it is much more amusing
          to run after butterflies, or to climb trees and to take the young
          birds out of their nests."</p>

     <p>"Poor little goose! But do you not know that in that
          way you will grow up a perfect donkey, and that every one
          will make fun of you?"</p>

     <p>"Hold your tongue, you wicked, ill-omened croaker!"
          shouted Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>But the Cricket, who was patient and philosophical, instead
          of becoming angry at this impertinence, continued in
          the same tone:</p>

     <p>"But if you do not wish to go to school why not at least
          learn a trade, if only to enable you to earn honestly a piece
          of bread!"</p>

     <p>"Do you want me to tell you?" replied Pinocchio, who
          was beginning to lose patience. "Amongst all the trades in
          the world there is only one that really takes my fancy."</p>

     <p>"And that trade&mdash;what is it?"</p>

     <p>"It is to eat, drink, sleep and amuse myself, and to lead
          a vagabond life from morning to night."</p>

     <p>"As a rule," said the Talking-Cricket, "all those who follow
          that trade end almost always either in a hospital or in
          prison."</p>

     <p>"Take care, you wicked, ill-omened croaker! Woe to you
          if I fly into a passion!"</p>

     <p>"Poor Pinocchio! I really pity you!"</p>

     <p>"Why do you pity me?"</p>

     <p>"Because you are a puppet and, what is worse, because
          you have a wooden head."</p>

     <p>At these last words Pinocchio jumped up in a rage and,
          snatching a wooden hammer from the bench, he threw it at
          the Talking-Cricket.</p>

     <p>Perhaps he never meant to hit him, but unfortunately it
          struck him exactly on the head, so that the poor Cricket had
          scarcely breath to cry "Cri-cri-cri!" and then he remained
          dried up and flattened against the wall.</p>

     <h2>THE FLYING EGG</h2>


     <p>Night was coming on and Pinocchio, remembering that
          he had eaten nothing all day, began to feel a gnawing
          in his stomach that very much resembled appetite.</p>

     <p>After a few minutes his appetite had become hunger
          and in no time his hunger became ravenous.</p>

     <p>Poor Pinocchio ran quickly to the fireplace, where a saucepan
          was boiling, and was going to take off the lid to see
          what was in it, but the saucepan was only painted on the
          wall. You can imagine his feelings. His nose, which was
          already long, became longer by at least three inches.</p>

     <p>He then began to run about the room, searching in the
          drawers and in every imaginable place, in hopes of finding a
          bit of bread. If it was only a bit of dry bread, a crust, a
          bone left by a dog, a little moldy pudding of Indian corn,
          a fish bone, a cherry stone&mdash;in fact, anything that he could
          gnaw. But he could find nothing, nothing at all, absolutely
          nothing.</p>

     <p>And in the meanwhile his hunger grew and grew. Poor
          Pinocchio had no other relief than yawning, and his yawns
          were so tremendous that sometimes his mouth almost reached
          his ears. And after he had yawned he spluttered and felt
          as if he were going to faint.</p>

     <p>Then he began to cry desperately, and he said:</p>

     <p>"The Talking-Cricket was right. I did wrong to rebel
          against my papa and to run away from home. If my papa
          were here I should not now be dying of yawning! Oh! what
          a dreadful illness hunger is!"</p>

     <p>Just then he thought he saw something in the dust-heap&mdash;something
          round and white that looked like a hen's egg. To
          give a spring and seize hold of it was the affair of a moment.
          It was indeed an egg.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio's joy was beyond description. Almost believing
          it must be a dream he kept turning the egg over in his hands,
          feeling it and kissing it. And as he kissed it he said:</p>

     <p>"And now, how shall I cook it? Shall I make an omelet?
          No, it would be better to cook it in a saucer! Or would it
          not be more savory to fry it in the frying-pan? Or shall I
          simply boil it? No, the quickest way of all is to cook it in
          a saucer: I am in such a hurry to eat it!"</p>

     <p>Without loss of time he placed an earthenware saucer on
          a brazier full of red-hot embers. Into the saucer instead of
          oil or butter he poured a little water; and when the water
          began to smoke, tac! he broke the egg-shell over it and let
          the contents drop in. But, instead of the white and the yolk
          a little chicken popped out very gay and polite. Making a
          beautiful courtesy it said to him:</p>

     <p>"A thousand thanks, Master Pinocchio, for saving me the
          trouble of breaking the shell. Adieu until we meet again.
          Keep well, and my best compliments to all at home!"</p>

     <p>Thus saying, it spread its wings, darted through the open
          window and, flying away, was lost to sight.</p>

     <p>The poor puppet stood as if he had been bewitched, with
          his eyes fixed, his mouth open, and the egg-shell in his hand.
          Recovering, however, from his first stupefaction, he began to
          cry and scream, and to stamp his feet on the floor in desperation,
          and amidst his sobs he said:</p>

     <p>"Ah, indeed, the Talking-Cricket was right. If I had not
          run away from home, and if my papa were here, I should
          not now be dying of hunger! Oh! what a dreadful illness
          hunger is!"</p>

     <p>And, as his stomach cried out more than ever and he did
          not know how to quiet it, he thought he would leave the house
          and make an excursion in the neighborhood in hopes of finding
          some charitable person who would give him a piece of bread.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO'S FEET BURN TO CINDERS</h2>


     <p>It was a wild and stormy night. The thunder was tremendous
          and the lightning so vivid that the sky seemed
          on fire.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio had a great fear of thunder, but hunger was
          stronger than fear. He therefore closed the house door and
          made a rush for the village, which he reached in a hundred
          bounds, with his tongue hanging out and panting for breath
          like a dog after game.</p>

     <p>But he found it all dark and deserted. The shops were
          closed, the windows shut, and there was not so much as a
          dog in the street. It seemed the land of the dead.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, urged by desperation and hunger, took hold
          of the bell of a house and began to ring it with all his might,
          saying to himself:</p>

     <p>"That will bring somebody."</p>

     <p>And so it did. A little old man appeared at a window
          with a night-cap on his head and called to him angrily:</p>

     <p>"What do you want at such an hour?"</p>

     <p>"Would you be kind enough to give me a little bread?"</p>

     <p>"Wait there, I will be back directly," said the little old
          man, thinking it was one of those rascally boys who amuse
          themselves at night by ringing the house-bells to rouse respectable
          people who are sleeping quietly.</p>

     <p>After half a minute the window was again opened and the
          voice of the same little old man shouted to Pinocchio:</p>

     <p>"Come underneath and hold out your cap."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio pulled off his cap; but, just as he held it out,
          an enormous basin of water was poured down on him, soaking
          him from head to foot as if he had been a pot of dried-up
          geraniums.</p>

     <p>He returned home like a wet chicken, quite exhausted
          with fatigue and hunger; and, having no longer strength to
          stand, he sat down and rested his damp and muddy feet on
          a brazier full of burning embers.</p>

     <p>And then he fell asleep, and whilst he slept his feet, which
          were wooden, took fire, and little by little they burnt away
          and became cinders.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio continued to sleep and to snore as if his feet
          belonged to some one else. At last about daybreak he awoke
          because some one was knocking at the door.</p>

     <p>"Who is there?" he asked, yawning and rubbing his eyes.</p>

     <p>"It is I!" answered a voice.</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio recognized Geppetto's voice.</p>

     <h2>GEPPETTO GIVES HIS OWN BREAKFAST
          TO PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>Poor Pinocchio, whose eyes were still half shut from sleep,
          had not as yet discovered that his feet were burnt off.
          The moment, therefore, that he heard his father's voice he
          slipped off his stool to run and open the door; but, after
          stumbling two or three times, he fell his whole length on
          the floor.</p>

     <p>And the noise he made in falling was as if a sack of
          wooden ladles had been thrown from a fifth story.</p>

     <p>"Open the door!" shouted Geppetto from the street.</p>

     <p>"Dear papa, I cannot," answered the puppet, crying
          and rolling about on the ground.</p>

     <p>"Why can't you?"</p>

     <p>"Because my feet have been eaten."</p>

     <p>"And who has eaten your feet?"</p>

     <p>"The cat," said Pinocchio, seeing the cat, who was amusing
          herself by making some shavings dance with her forepaws.</p>

     <p>"Open the door, I tell you!" repeated Geppetto. "If
          you don't, when I get into the house you shall have the cat
          from me!"</p>

     <p>"I cannot stand up, believe me. Oh, poor me! poor me!
          I shall have to walk on my knees for the rest of my life!"</p>

     <p>Geppetto, believing that all this lamentation was only
          another of the puppet's tricks, thought of a means of putting
          an end to it, and, climbing up the wall, he got in at the window.</p>

     <p>He was very angry and at first he did nothing but scold;
          but when he saw his Pinocchio lying on the ground and really
          without feet he was quite overcome. He took him in his arms
          and began to kiss and caress him, and to say a thousand
          endearing things to him, and as the big tears ran down his
          cheeks he said, sobbing:</p>

     <p>"My little Pinocchio! how did you manage to burn your
          feet?"</p>

     <p>"I don't know, papa, but it has been such a dreadful night
          that I shall remember it as long as I live. It thundered
          and lightened, and I was very hungry, and then the Talking-Cricket
          said to me: 'It serves you right; you have been
          wicked and you deserve it,' and I said to him: 'Take care,
          Cricket!' and he said: 'You are a puppet and you have a
          wooden head,' and I threw the handle of a hammer at him,
          and he died, but the fault was his, for I didn't wish to kill
          him, and the proof of it is that I put an earthenware saucer
          on a brazier of burning embers, but a chicken flew out and
          said: 'Adieu until we meet again, and many compliments to
          all at home': and I got still more hungry, for which reason
          that little old man in a night-cap, opening the window, said
          to me: 'Come underneath and hold out your hat,' and poured
          a basinful of water on my head, because asking for a little
          bread isn't a disgrace, is it? and I returned home at once, and
          because I was always very hungry I put my feet on the
          brazier to dry them, and then you returned, and I found they
          were burnt off, and I am always hungry, but I have no longer
          any feet! Oh! oh! oh! oh!" And poor Pinocchio began to
          cry and to roar so loudly that he was heard five miles off.</p>

     <p>Geppetto, who from all this jumbled account had only
          understood one thing, which was that the puppet was dying
          of hunger, drew from his pocket three pears and, giving them
          to him, said:</p>

     <p>"These three pears were intended for my breakfast, but
          I will give them to you willingly. Eat them, and I hope
          they will do you good."</p>

     <p>"If you wish me to eat them, be kind enough to peel
          them for me."</p>

     <p>"Peel them?" said Geppetto, astonished. "I should never
          have thought, my boy, that you were so dainty and fastidious.
          That is bad! In this world we should accustom ourselves
          from childhood to like and to eat everything, for there is no
          saying to what we may be brought. There are so many
          chances!"</p>

     <p>"You are no doubt right," interrupted Pinocchio, "but I
          will never eat fruit that has not been peeled. I cannot bear
          rind."</p>

     <p>So good Geppetto peeled the three pears and put the rind
          on a corner of the table.</p>

     <p>Having eaten the first pear in two mouthfuls, Pinocchio
          was about to throw away the core, but Geppetto caught hold
          of his arm and said to him:</p>

     <p>"Do not throw it away; in this world everything may
          be of use."</p>

     <p>"But core I am determined I will not eat," shouted the
          puppet, turning upon him like a viper.</p>

     <p>"Who knows! there are so many chances!" repeated Geppetto,
          without losing his temper.</p>

     <p>And so the three cores, instead of being thrown out of
          the window, were placed on the corner of the table, together
          with the three rinds.</p>

     <p>Having eaten, or rather having devoured the three pears,
          Pinocchio yawned tremendously, and then said in a fretful tone:</p>

     <p>"I am as hungry as ever!"</p>

     <p>"But, my boy, I have nothing more to give you!"</p>

     <p>"Nothing, really nothing?"</p>

     <p>"I have only the rind and the cores of the three pears."</p>

     <p>"One must have patience!" said Pinocchio; "if there is
          nothing else I will eat a rind."</p>

     <p>And he began to chew it. At first he made a wry face,
          but then one after another he quickly disposed of the rinds:
          and after the rinds even the cores, and when he had eaten
          up everything he clapped his hands on his sides in his satisfaction
          and said joyfully:</p>

     <p>"Ah! now I feel comfortable."</p>

     <p>"You see, now," observed Geppetto, "that I was right
          when I said to you that it did not do to accustom ourselves
          to be too particular or too dainty in our tastes. We can
          never know, my dear boy, what may happen to us. There
          are so many chances!"</p>

     <h2>GEPPETTO MAKES PINOCCHIO NEW FEET</h2>


     <p>No sooner had the puppet satisfied his hunger than he began
          to cry and to grumble because he wanted a pair of
          new feet.</p>

     <p>But Geppetto, to punish him for his naughtiness, allowed
          him to cry and to despair for half the day. He then said
          to him:</p>

     <p>"Why should I make you new feet? To enable you,
          perhaps, to escape again from home?"</p>

     <p>"I promise you," said the puppet, sobbing, "that for the
          future I will be good."</p>

     <p>"All boys," replied Geppetto, "when they are bent upon
          obtaining something, say the same thing."</p>

     <p>"I promise you that I will go to school and that I will
          study and bring home a good report."</p>

     <p>"All boys, when they are bent on obtaining something,
          repeat the same story."</p>

     <p>"But I am not like other boys! I am better than all of
          them and I always speak the truth. I promise you, papa,
          that I will learn a trade and that I will be the consolation
          and the staff of your old age."</p>

     <p>Geppetto's eyes filled with tears and his heart was sad at
          seeing his poor Pinocchio in such a pitiable state. He did
          not say another word, but, taking his tools and two small
          pieces of well-seasoned wood, he set to work with great diligence.</p>

     <p>In less than an hour the feet were finished: two little
          feet&mdash;swift, well-knit and nervous. They might have been
          modelled by an artist of genius.</p>

     <p>Geppetto then said to the puppet:</p>

     <p>"Shut your eyes and go to sleep!"</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio shut his eyes and pretended to be asleep.</p>

     <p>And whilst he pretended to sleep, Geppetto, with a little
          glue which he had melted in an egg-shell, fastened his feet
          in their place, and it was so well done that not even a trace
          could be seen of where they were joined.</p>

     <p>No sooner had the puppet discovered that he had feet
          than he jumped down from the table on which he was lying
          and began to spring and to cut a thousand capers about the
          room, as if he had gone mad with the greatness of his delight.</p>

     <p>"To reward you for what you have done for me," said
          Pinocchio to his father, "I will go to school at once."</p>

     <p>"Good boy."</p>

     <p>"But to go to school I shall want some clothes."</p>

     <p>Geppetto, who was poor and who had not so much as a
          penny in his pocket, then made him a little dress of flowered
          paper, a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree, and a cap
          of the crumb of bread.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio ran immediately to look at himself in a crock
          of water, and he was so pleased with his appearance that he
          said, strutting about like a peacock:</p>

     <p>"I look quite like a gentleman!"</p>

     <p>"Yes, indeed," answered Geppetto, "for bear in mind
          that it is not fine clothes that make the gentleman, but rather
          clean clothes."</p>

     <p>"By the bye," added the puppet, "to go to school I am
          still in want&mdash;indeed, I am without the best thing, and the
          most important."</p>

     <p>"And what is it?"</p>

     <p>"I have no spelling-book."</p>

     <p>"You are right: but what shall we do to get one?"</p>

     <p>"It is quite easy. We have only to go to the bookseller's
          and buy it."</p>

     <p>"And the money?"</p>

     <p>"I have got none."</p>

     <p>"Neither have I," added the good old man, very sadly.</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio, although he was a very merry boy, became
          sad also, because poverty, when it is real poverty, is
          understood by everybody&mdash;even by boys.</p>

     <p>"Well, patience!" exclaimed Geppetto, all at once rising
          to his feet, and putting on his old corduroy coat, all patched
          and darned, he ran out of the house.</p>

     <p>He returned shortly, holding in his hand a spelling-book
          for Pinocchio, but the old coat was gone. The poor man was
          in his shirt-sleeves and out of doors it was snowing.</p>

     <p>"And the coat, papa?"</p>

     <p>"I have sold it."</p>

     <p>"Why did you sell it?"</p>

     <p>"Because I found it too hot."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio understood this answer in an instant, and unable
          to restrain the impulse of his good heart he sprang up and,
          throwing his arms around Geppetto's neck, he began kissing
          him again and again.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO GOES TO SEE A PUPPET-SHOW</h2>


     <p>As soon as it stopped snowing Pinocchio set out for school
          with his fine spelling-book under his arm. As he went
          along he began to imagine a thousand things in his little brain
          and to build a thousand castles in the air, one more beautiful
          than the other.</p>

     <p>And, talking to himself, he said:</p>

     <p>"Today at school I will learn to read at once; then tomorrow
          I will begin to write, and the day after tomorrow
          to figure. Then, with my acquirements, I will earn a great
          deal of money, and with the first money I have in my pocket
          I will immediately buy for my papa a beautiful new cloth
          coat. But what am I saying? Cloth, indeed! It shall be
          all made of gold and silver, and it shall have diamond buttons.
          That poor man really deserves it, for to buy me books and
          have me taught he has remained in his shirt-sleeves. And in
          this cold! It is only fathers who are capable of such sacrifices!"</p>

     <p>Whilst he was saying this with great emotion, he thought
          that he heard music in the distance that sounded like fifes
          and the beating of a big drum: Fi-fie-fi, fi-fi-fi; zum, zum, zum.</p>

     <p>He stopped and listened. The sounds came from the end
          of a cross street that led to a little village on the seashore.</p>

     <p>"What can that music be? What a pity that I have to
          go to school, or else&mdash;"</p>

     <p>And he remained irresolute. It was, however, necessary
          to come to a decision. Should he go to school? or should he
          go after the fifes?</p>

     <p>"Today I will go and hear the fifes, and tomorrow I
          will go to school," finally decided the young scapegrace, shrugging
          his shoulders.</p>

     <p>The more he ran the nearer came the sounds of the
          fifes and the beating of the big drum: Fi-fi-fi; zum, zum,
          zum, zum.</p>

     <p>At last he found himself in the middle of a square quite
          full of people, who were all crowded round a building made
          of wood and canvas, and painted a thousand colors.</p>

     <p>"What is that building?" asked Pinocchio, turning to a
          little boy who belonged to the place.</p>

     <p>"Read the placard&mdash;it is all written&mdash;and then you will
          know."</p>

     <p>"I would read it willingly, but it so happens that today
          I don't know how to read."</p>

     <p>"Bravo, blockhead! Then I will read it to you. The writing
          on that placard in those letters red as fire is:</p>

     <p class="placard">&quot;<span class="smcap">The Great Puppet Theater</span>.&quot;</p>

     <p>"Has the play begun long?"</p>

     <p>"It is beginning now."</p>

     <p>"How much does it cost to go in?"</p>

     <p>"A dime."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, who was in a fever of curiosity, lost all control
          of himself, and without any shame he said to the little boy
          to whom he was talking:</p>

     <p>"Would you lend me a dime until tomorrow?"</p>

     <p>"I would lend it to you willingly," said the other, "but
          it so happens that today I cannot give it to you."</p>

     <p>"I will sell you my jacket for a dime," the puppet then
          said to him.</p>

     <p>"What do you think that I could do with a jacket of
          flowered paper? If there were rain and it got wet, it would
          be impossible to get it off my back."</p>

     <p>"Will you buy my shoes?"</p>

     <p>"They would only be of use to light the fire."</p>

     <p>"How much will you give me for my cap?"</p>

     <p>"That would be a wonderful acquisition indeed! A cap
          of bread crumb! There would be a risk of the mice coming
          to eat it whilst it was on my head."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio was on thorns. He was on the point of making
          another offer, but he had not the courage. He hesitated, felt
          irresolute and remorseful. At last he said:</p>

     <p>"Will you give me a dime for this new spelling-book?"</p>

     <p>"I am a boy and I don't buy from boys," replied his little
          interlocutor, who had much more sense than he had.</p>

     <p>"I will buy the spelling-book for a dime," called out a
          hawker of old clothes, who had been listening to the conversation.</p>

     <p>And the book was sold there and then. And to think
          that poor Geppetto had remained at home trembling with cold
          in his shirt-sleeves in order that his son should have a spelling-book.</p>

     <h2>THE PUPPETS RECOGNIZE THEIR BROTHER PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>When Pinocchio came into the little puppet theater, an
          incident occurred that almost produced a revolution.</p>

     <p>The curtain had gone up and the play had already begun.</p>

     <p>On the stage Harlequin and Punch were as usual quarrelling
          with each other and threatening every moment to come
          to blows.</p>

     <p>All at once Harlequin stopped short and, turning to the
          public, he pointed with his hand to some one far down in
          the pit and exclaimed in a dramatic tone:</p>

     <p>"Gods of the firmament! Do I dream or am I awake?
          But surely that is Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>"It is indeed Pinocchio!" cried Punch.</p>

     <p>"It is indeed himself!" screamed Miss Rose, peeping from
          behind the scenes.</p>

     <p>"It is Pinocchio! it is Pinocchio!" shouted all the puppets
          in chorus, leaping from all sides on to the stage. "It is
          Pinocchio! It is our brother Pinocchio! Long live Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio, come up here to me," cried Harlequin, "and
          throw yourself into the arms of your wooden brothers!"</p>

     <p>At this affectionate invitation Pinocchio made a leap from
          the end of the pit into the reserved seats; another leap landed
          him on the head of the leader of the orchestra, and he then
          sprang upon the stage.</p>

     <p>The embraces, the friendly pinches, and the demonstrations
          of warm brotherly affection that Pinocchio received from
          the excited crowd of actors and actresses of the puppet dramatic
          company are beyond description.</p>

     <p>The sight was doubtless a moving one, but the public in
          the pit, finding that the play was stopped, became impatient
          and began to shout: "We will have the play&mdash;go on with
          the play!"</p>

     <p>It was all breath thrown away. The puppets, instead of
          continuing the recital, redoubled their noise and outcries, and,
          putting Pinocchio on their shoulders, they carried him in triumph
          before the footlights.</p>

     <p>At that moment out came the showman. He was very
          big, and so ugly that the sight of him was enough to frighten
          anyone. His beard was as black as ink, and so long that it
          reached from his chin to the ground. I need only say that
          he trod upon it when he walked. His mouth was as big as
          an oven, and his eyes were like two lanterns of red glass with
          lights burning inside them. He carried a large whip made of
          snakes and foxes' tails twisted together, which he cracked
          constantly.</p>

     <p>At his unexpected appearance there was a profound silence:
          no one dared to breathe. A fly might have been heard in the
          stillness. The poor puppets of both sexes trembled like so
          many leaves.</p>

     <p>"Why have you come to raise a disturbance in my theater?"
          asked the showman of Pinocchio, in the gruff voice of a hobgoblin
          suffering from a severe cold in the head.</p>

     <p>"Believe me, honored sir, it was not my fault!"</p>

     <p>"That is enough! Tonight we will settle our accounts."</p>

     <p>As soon as the play was over the showman went into the
          kitchen, where a fine sheep, preparing for his supper, was turning
          slowly on the spit in front of the fire. As there was not
          enough wood to finish roasting and browning it, he called
          Harlequin and Punch, and said to them:</p>

     <p>"Bring that puppet here: you will find him hanging on
          a nail. It seems to me that he is made of very dry wood and
          I am sure that if he were thrown on the fire he would make
          a beautiful blaze for the roast."</p>

     <p>At first Harlequin and Punch hesitated; but, appalled by
          a severe glance from their master, they obeyed. In a short
          time they returned to the kitchen carrying poor Pinocchio, who
          was wriggling like an eel taken out of water and screaming
          desperately: "Papa! papa! save me! I will not die, I will
          not die!"</p>

     <h2>FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>The showman, Fire-Eater&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;looked
          like a wicked man, especially with his black beard that
          covered his chest and legs like an apron. On the whole, however,
          he had not a bad heart. In proof of this, when he saw
          poor Pinocchio brought before him, struggling and screaming
          "I will not die, I will not die!" he was quite moved and felt
          very sorry for him. He tried to hold out, but after a little
          he could stand it no longer and he sneezed violently. When
          he heard the sneeze, Harlequin, who up to that moment had
          been in the deepest affliction and bowed down like a weeping
          willow, became quite cheerful and, leaning towards Pinocchio,
          he whispered to him softly:</p>

     <p>"Good news, brother. The showman has sneezed and that
          is a sign that he pities you, and consequently you are saved."</p>

     <p>Most men, when they feel compassion for somebody, either
          weep or at least pretend to dry their eyes. Fire-Eater, on
          the contrary, whenever he was really overcome, had the habit
          of sneezing.</p>

     <p>After he had sneezed, the showman, still acting the ruffian,
          shouted to Pinocchio:</p>

     <p>"Have done crying! Your lamentations have given me
          a pain in my stomach. I feel a spasm that almost&mdash;Etchoo!
          etchoo!" and he sneezed again twice.</p>

     <p>"Bless you!" said Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Thank you! And your papa and your mamma, are they
          still alive?" asked Fire-Eater.</p>

     <p>"Papa, yes; my mamma I have never known."</p>

     <p>"Who can say what a sorrow it would be for your poor
          old father if I were to have you thrown amongst those burning
          coals! Poor old man! I pity him! Etchoo! etchoo!
          etchoo!" and he sneezed again three times.</p>

     <p>"Bless you" said Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Thank you! All the same, some compassion is due to
          me, for as you see I have no more wood with which to finish
          roasting my mutton, and, to tell you the truth, under the circumstances
          you would have been of great use to me! However,
          I have had pity on you, so I must have patience. Instead
          of you I will burn under the spit one of the puppets belonging
          to my company. Ho there, gendarmes!"</p>

     <p>At this call two wooden gendarmes immediately appeared.
          They were very long and very thin, and had on cocked hats,
          and held unsheathed swords in their hands.</p>

     <p>The showman said to them in a hoarse voice:</p>

     <p>"Take Harlequin, bind him securely, and then throw him
          on the fire to burn. I am determined that my mutton shall
          be well roasted."</p>

     <p>Only imagine that poor Harlequin! His terror was so
          great that his legs bent under him, and he fell with his face
          on the ground.</p>

     <p>At this agonizing sight Pinocchio, weeping bitterly, threw
          himself at the showman's feet and, bathing his long beard with
          his tears, he began to say, in a supplicating voice:</p>

     <p>"Have pity, Sir Fire-Eater!"</p>

     <p>"Here there are no sirs," the showman answered severely.</p>

     <p>"Have pity, Sir Knight!"</p>

     <p>"Here there are no knights!"</p>

     <p>"Have pity, Commander!"</p>

     <p>"Here there are no commanders!"</p>

     <p>"Have pity, Excellence!"</p>

     <p>Upon hearing himself called Excellence the showman
          began to smile and became at once kinder and more tractable.
          Turning to Pinocchio, he asked:</p>

     <p>"Well, what do you want from me?"</p>

     <p>"I implore you to pardon poor Harlequin."</p>

     <p>"For him there can be no pardon. As I have spared you
          he must be put on the fire, for I am determined that my
          mutton shall be well roasted."</p>

     <p>"In that case," cried Pinocchio proudly, rising and throwing
          away his cap of bread crumb&mdash;"in that case I know my
          duty. Come on, gendarmes! Bind me and throw me amongst
          the flames. No, it is not just that poor Harlequin, my true
          friend, should die for me!"</p>

     <p>These words, pronounced in a loud, heroic voice, made all
          the puppets who were present cry. Even the gendarmes,
          although they were made of wood, wept like two newly born
          lambs.</p>

     <p>Fire-Eater at first remained as hard and unmoved as ice,
          but little by little he began to melt and to sneeze. And,
          having sneezed four or five times, he opened his arms affectionately
          and said to Pinocchio:</p>

     <p>"You are a good, brave boy! Come here and give me
          a kiss."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio ran at once and, climbing like a squirrel up the
          showman's beard, he deposited a hearty kiss on the point of
          his nose.</p>

     <p>"Then the pardon is granted?" asked poor Harlequin in
          a faint voice that was scarcely audible.</p>

     <p>"The pardon is granted!" answered Fire-Eater; he then
          added, sighing and shaking his head:</p>

     <p>"I must have patience! Tonight I shall have to resign
          myself to eat the mutton half raw; but another time, woe to
          him who displeases me!"</p>

     <p>At the news of the pardon the puppets all ran to the
          stage and, having lighted the lamps and chandeliers as if for
          a full-dress performance, they began to leap and to dance
          merrily. At dawn they were still dancing.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO RECEIVES A PRESENT OF FIVE GOLD PIECES</h2>


     <p>The following day Fire-Eater called Pinocchio to one side
          and asked him:</p>

     <p>"What is your father's name?"</p>

     <p>"Geppetto."</p>

     <p>"And what trade does he follow?"</p>

     <p>"He is a beggar."</p>

     <p>"Does he gain much?"</p>

     <p>"Gain much? Why, he has never a penny in his pocket.
          Only think, in order to buy a spelling-book so that I could
          go to school he was obliged to sell the only coat he had to
          wear&mdash;a coat that, between patches and darns, was not fit to
          be seen."</p>

     <p>"Poor devil! I feel almost sorry for him! Here are five
          gold pieces. Go at once and take them to him with my compliments."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio was overjoyed and thanked the showman a thousand
          times. He embraced all the puppets of the company one
          by one, even to the gendarmes, and set out to return home.</p>

     <p>But he had not gone far when he met on the road a
          Fox lame of one foot, and a Cat blind of both eyes, and they
          were going along helping each other like good companions in
          misfortune. The Fox, who was lame, walked leaning on the
          Cat; and the Cat, who was blind, was guided by the Fox.</p>

     <p>"Good-day, Pinocchio," said the Fox, greeting him politely.</p>

     <p>"How do you come to know my name?" asked the puppet.</p>

     <p>"I know your father well."</p>

     <p>"Where did you see him?"</p>

     <p>"I saw him yesterday at the door of his house."</p>

     <p>"And what was he doing?"</p>

     <p>"He was in his shirt-sleeves and shivering with cold."</p>

     <p>"Poor papa! But that is over; for the future he shall
          shiver no more!"</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because I have become a gentleman."</p>

     <p>"A gentleman&mdash;you!" said the Fox, and he began to laugh
          rudely and scornfully. The Cat also began to laugh, but to
          conceal it she combed her whiskers with her forepaws.</p>


     <p>"There is little to laugh at," cried Pinocchio angrily. "I
          am really sorry to make your mouth water, but if you know
          anything about it, you can see that these are five gold pieces."</p>

     <p>And he pulled out the money that Fire-Eater had given him.</p>

     <p>At the jingling of the money the Fox, with an involuntary
          movement, stretched out the paw that seemed crippled,
          and the Cat opened wide two eyes that looked like two green
          lanterns. It is true that she shut them again, and so quickly
          that Pinocchio observed nothing.</p>

     <p>"And now," asked the Fox, "what are you going to do
          with all that money?"</p>

     <p>"First of all," answered the puppet, "I intend to buy a
          new coat for my papa, made of gold and silver, and with
          diamond buttons; and then I will buy a spelling-book for
          myself."</p>

     <p>"For yourself?"</p>

     <p>"Yes indeed, for I wish to go to school to study in earnest."</p>

     <p>"Look at me!" said the Fox. "Through my foolish passion
          for study I have lost a leg."</p>

     <p>"Look at me!" said the Cat. "Through my foolish passion
          for study I have lost the sight of both my eyes."</p>

     <p>At that moment a white Blackbird, that was perched on
          the hedge by the road, began his usual song, and said:</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio, don't listen to the advice of bad companions;
          if you do you will repent it!"</p>

     <p>Poor Blackbird! If only he had not spoken! The Cat,
          with a great leap, sprang upon him, and without even giving
          him time to say "Oh!" ate him in a mouthful, feathers and all.</p>

     <p>Having eaten him and cleaned her mouth she shut her
          eyes again and feigned blindness as before.</p>

     <p>"Poor Blackbird!" said Pinocchio to the Cat, "why did
          you treat him so badly?"</p>

     <p>"I did it to give him a lesson. He will learn another
          time not to meddle in other people's conversation."</p>

     <p>They had gone almost half-way when the Fox, halting
          suddenly, said to the puppet:</p>

     <p>"Would you like to double your money?"</p>

     <p>"In what way?"</p>

     <p>"Would you like to make out of your five miserable sovereigns,
          a hundred, a thousand, two thousand?"</p>

     <p>"I should think so! but in what way?"</p>

     <p>"The way is easy enough. Instead of returning home
          you must go with us."</p>

     <p>"And where do you wish to take me?"</p>

     <p>"To the land of the Owls."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio reflected a moment, and then he said resolutely:</p>

     <p>"No, I will not go. I am already close to the house, and
          I will return home to my papa, who is waiting for me. Who
          can tell how often the poor old man must have sighed yesterday
          when I did not come back! I have indeed been a bad
          son, and the Talking-Cricket was right when he said: 'Disobedient
          boys never come to any good in the world.' I have
          found it to be true, for many misfortunes have happened to
          me. Even yesterday in Fire-Eater's house I ran the risk&mdash;Oh!
          it makes me shudder only to think of it!"</p>

     <p>"Well, then," said the Fox, "you are quite decided to go
          home? Go, then, and so much the worse for you."</p>

     <p>"So much the worse for you!" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"Think well of it, Pinocchio, for you are giving a kick
          to fortune."</p>

     <p>"To fortune!" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"Between today and tomorrow your five sovereigns would
          have become two thousand."</p>

     <p>"Two thousand!" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"But how is it possible that they could become so many?"
          asked Pinocchio, remaining with his mouth open from astonishment.</p>

     <p>"I will explain it to you at once," said the Fox. "You
          must know that in the land of the Owls there is a sacred
          field called by everybody the Field of Miracles. In this field
          you must dig a little hole, and you put into it, we will say,
          one gold sovereign. You then cover up the hole with a little
          earth; you must water it with two pails of water from the
          fountain, then sprinkle it with two pinches of salt, and when
          night comes you can go quietly to bed. In the meanwhile,
          during the night, the gold piece will grow and flower, and
          in the morning when you get up and return to the field, what
          do you find? You find a beautiful tree laden with as many
          gold sovereigns as a fine ear of corn has grains in the month
          of June."</p>

     <p>"So that," said Pinocchio, more and more bewildered, "supposing
          I buried my five sovereigns in that field, how many
          should I find there the following morning?"</p>

     <p>"That is an exceedingly easy calculation," replied the Fox,
          "a calculation that you can make on the ends of your fingers.
          Every sovereign will give you an increase of five hundred;
          multiply five hundred by five, and the following morning will
          find you with two thousand five hundred shining gold pieces
          in your pocket."</p>

     <p>"Oh! how delightful!" cried Pinocchio, dancing for joy.
          "As soon as ever I have obtained those sovereigns, I will keep
          two thousand for myself and the other five hundred I will
          make a present of to you two."</p>

     <p>"A present to us?" cried the Fox with indignation and
          appearing much offended. "What are you dreaming of?"</p>

     <p>"What are you dreaming of?" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"We do not work," said the Fox, "for interest: we work
          solely to enrich others."</p>

     <p>"Others!" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"What good people!" thought Pinocchio to himself, and,
          forgetting there and then his papa, the new coat, the spelling-book,
          and all his good resolutions, he said to the Fox and
          the Cat:</p>

     <p>"Let us be off at once. I will go with you."</p>

     <h2>THE INN OF THE RED CRAW-FISH</h2>


     <p>They walked, and walked, and walked, until at last, towards
          evening, they arrived, all tired out, at the inn of The
          Red Craw-Fish.</p>

     <p>"Let us stop here a little," said the Fox, "that we may
          have something to eat, and rest ourselves for an hour or two.
          We will start again at midnight, so as to arrive at the Field
          of Miracles by dawn tomorrow morning."</p>

     <p>Having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table,
          but none of them had any appetite.</p>

     <p>The Cat, who was suffering from indigestion and feeling
          seriously indisposed, could only eat thirty-five fish with tomato
          sauce and four portions of tripe with Parmesan cheese; and
          because she thought the tripe was not seasoned enough, she
          asked three times for the butter and grated cheese!</p>

     <p>The Fox would also willingly have picked a little, but as
          his doctor had ordered him a strict diet, he was forced to content
          himself simply with a hare dressed with a sweet and sour
          sauce, and garnished lightly with fat chickens and early pullets.
          After the hare he sent for a made dish of partridges, rabbits,
          frogs, lizards and other delicacies; he could not touch anything
          else. He cared so little for food, he said, that he could put
          nothing to his lips.</p>

     <p>The one who ate the least was Pinocchio. He asked for
          some walnuts and a hunch of bread, and left everything on
          his plate. The poor boy's thoughts were continually fixed on
          the Field of Miracles.</p>

     <p>When they had supped, the Fox said to the host:</p>

     <p>"Give us two good rooms, one for Mr. Pinocchio, and
          the other for me and my companion. We will snatch a little
          sleep before we leave. Remember, however, that at midnight
          we wish to be called to continue our journey."</p>

     <p>"Yes, gentlemen," answered the host, and he winked at
          the Fox and the Cat, as much as to say: "I know what you
          are up to. We understand one another!"</p>

     <p>No sooner had Pinocchio got into bed than he fell asleep
          at once and began to dream. And he dreamed that he was
          in the middle of a field, and the field was full of shrubs covered
          with clusters of gold sovereigns, and as they swung in the wind
          they went zin, zin, zin, almost as if they would say: "Let
          who will, come and take us." But just as Pinocchio was
          stretching out his hand to pick handfuls of those beautiful
          gold pieces and to put them in his pocket, he was suddenly
          awakened by three violent blows on the door of his room.</p>

     <p>It was the host who had come to tell him that midnight
          had struck.</p>

     <p>"Are my companions ready?" asked the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Ready! Why, they left two hours ago."</p>

     <p>"Why were they in such a hurry?"</p>

     <p>"Because the Cat had received a message to say that her
          eldest kitten was ill with chilblains on his feet and was in
          danger of death."</p>

     <p>"Did they pay for the supper?"</p>

     <p>"What are you thinking of? They are too well educated
          to dream of offering such an insult to a gentleman like you."</p>

     <p>"What a pity! It is an insult that would have given me
          so much pleasure!" said Pinocchio, scratching his head. He
          then asked:</p>

     <p>"And where did my good friends say they would wait
          for me?"</p>

     <p>"At the Field of Miracles, tomorrow morning at daybreak."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio paid a sovereign for his supper and that of his
          companions, and then left.</p>

     <p>Outside the inn it was so pitch dark that he had almost
          to grope his way, for it was impossible to see a hand's breadth
          in front of him. Some night-birds flying across the road from
          one hedge to the other brushed Pinocchio's nose with their
          wings as they passed, which caused him so much terror that,
          springing back, he shouted: "Who goes there?" and the echo
          in the surrounding hills repeated in the distance: "Who goes
          there? Who goes there?"</p>

     <p>As he was walking along he saw a little insect shining
          dimly on the trunk of a tree, like a night-light in a lamp of
          transparent china.</p>

     <p>"Who are you?" asked Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"I am the ghost of the Talking-Cricket," answered the
          insect in a low voice, so weak and faint that it seemed to come
          from the other world.</p>

     <p>"What do you want with me?" said the puppet.</p>

     <p>"I want to give you some advice. Go back and take the
          four sovereigns that you have left to your poor father, who
          is weeping and in despair because you have not returned to him."</p>

     <p>"By tomorrow my papa will be a gentleman, for these
          four sovereigns will have become two thousand."</p>

     <p>"Don't trust to those who promise to make you rich in
          a day. Usually they are either mad or rogues! Give ear
          to me, and go back, my boy."</p>

     <p>"On the contrary, I am determined to go on."</p>

     <p>"The hour is late!"</p>

     <p>"I am determined to go on."</p>

     <p>"The night is dark!"</p>

     <p>"I am determined to go on."</p>

     <p>"The road is dangerous!"</p>

     <p>"I am determined to go on."</p>

     <p>"Remember that boys who are bent on following their
          caprices, and will have their own way, sooner or later repent it."</p>

     <p>"Always the same stories. Good-night, Cricket."</p>

     <p>"Good-night, Pinocchio, and may Heaven preserve you
          from dangers and from assassins."</p>

     <p>No sooner had he said these words than the Talking-Cricket
          vanished suddenly like a light that has been blown
          out, and the road became darker than ever.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO FALLS AMONGST ASSASSINS</h2>


     <p>"Really," said the puppet to himself, as he resumed his
          journey, "how unfortunate we poor boys are. Everybody
          scolds us and gives us good advice. See now; because I don't
          choose to listen to that tiresome Cricket, who knows, according
          to him, how many misfortunes are to happen to me! I am
          even to meet with assassins! That is, however, of little consequence,
          for I don't believe in assassins&mdash;I have never believed
          in them. For me, I think that assassins have been invented
          purposely by papas to frighten boys who want to go out at
          night. Besides, supposing I was to come across them here in
          the road, do you imagine they would frighten me? Not the
          least in the world. I should go to meet them and cry: 'Gentlemen
          assassins, what do you want with me? Remember that
          with me there is no joking. Therefore go about your business
          and be quiet!' At this speech they would run away like the
          wind. If, however, they were so badly educated as not to run
          away, why, then I would run away myself and there would
          be an end of it."</p>

     <p>But Pinocchio had not time to finish his reasoning, for at
          that moment he thought that he heard a slight rustle of leaves
          behind him.</p>

     <p>He turned to look and saw in the gloom two evil-looking
          black figures completely enveloped in charcoal sacks. They
          were running after him on tiptoe and making great leaps like
          two phantoms.</p>

     <p>"Here they are in reality!" he said to himself and, not
          knowing where to hide his gold pieces, he put them in his
          mouth precisely under his tongue.</p>

     <p>Then he tried to escape. But he had not gone a step
          when he felt himself seized by the arm and heard two horrid,
          sepulchral voices saying to him:</p>

     <p>"Your money or your life!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, not being able to answer in words, owing to
          the money that was in his mouth, made a thousand low bows
          and a thousand pantomimes. He tried thus to make the two
          muffled figures, whose eyes were only visible through the holes
          in their sacks, understand that he was a poor puppet, and that
          he had not as much as a counterfeit nickel in his pocket.</p>

     <p>"Come, now! Less nonsense and out with the money!"
          cried the two brigands threateningly.</p>

     <p>And the puppet made a gesture with his hands to signify:
          "I have none."</p>

     <p>"Deliver up your money or you are dead," said the tallest
          of the brigands.</p>

     <p>"Dead!" repeated the other.</p>

     <p>"And after we have killed you, we will also kill your
          father!"</p>

     <p>"Also your father!"</p>

     <p>"No, no, no, not my poor papa!" cried Pinocchio in a
          despairing voice, and as he said it the sovereigns clinked in
          his mouth.</p>

     <p>"Ah! you rascal! Then you have hidden your money under
          your tongue! Spit it out at once!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio was obstinate.</p>

     <p>"Ah! you pretend to be deaf, do you? Wait a moment,
          leave it to us to find a means to make you give it up."</p>

     <p>And one of them seized the puppet by the end of his
          nose, and the other took him by the chin, and began to pull
          them brutally, the one up and the other down, to force him
          to open his mouth. But it was all to no purpose. Pinocchio's
          mouth seemed to be nailed and riveted together.</p>

     <p>Then the shorter assassin drew out an ugly knife and tried
          to put it between his lips like a lever or chisel. But Pinocchio,
          as quick as lightning, caught his hand with his teeth, and with
          one bite bit it clear off and spat it out. Imagine his astonishment
          when instead of a hand he perceived that a cat's paw
          lay on the ground.</p>

     <p>Encouraged by this first victory he used his nails to such
          purpose that he succeeded in liberating himself from his assailants,
          and, jumping the hedge by the roadside, he began to fly
          across the country. The assassins ran after him like two dogs
          chasing a hare, and the one who had lost a paw ran on one
          leg, and no one ever knew how he managed it.</p>

     <p>After a race of some miles Pinocchio could go no more.
          Giving himself up for lost, he climbed the trunk of a very
          high pine tree and seated himself in the topmost branches. The
          assassins attempted to climb after him, but when they had
          reached half-way up they slid down again and arrived on
          the ground with the skin grazed from their hands and knees.</p>

     <p>But they were not to be beaten by so little; collecting a
          quantity of dry wood, they piled it beneath the pine and set
          fire to it. In less time than it takes to tell, the pine began
          to burn and to flame like a candle blown by the wind. Pinocchio,
          seeing that the flames were mounting higher every instant,
          and not wishing to end his life like a roasted pigeon, made
          a stupendous leap from the top of the tree and started afresh
          across the fields and vineyards. The assassins followed him,
          and kept behind him without once giving up.</p>

     <p>The day began to break and they were still pursuing him.
          Suddenly Pinocchio found his way barred by a wide, deep
          ditch full of stagnant water the color of coffee. What was he
          to do? "One! two! three!" cried the puppet, and, making a
          rush, he sprang to the other side. The assassins also jumped,
          but not having measured the distance properly&mdash;splash! splash!
          they fell into the very middle of the ditch. Pinocchio, who
          heard the plunge and the splashing of the water, shouted out,
          laughing, and without stopping:</p>

     <p>"A fine bath to you, gentleman assassins."</p>

     <p>And he felt convinced that they were drowned, when,
          turning to look, he perceived that, on the contrary, they were
          both running after him, still enveloped in their sacks, with
          the water dripping from them as if they had been two hollow
          baskets.</p>

     <h2>THE ASSASSINS HANG PINOCCHIO TO THE BIG OAK</h2>


     <p>At this sight the puppet's courage failed him and he was
          on the point of throwing himself on the ground and giving
          himself over for lost. Turning, however, his eyes in every
          direction, he saw, at some distance, a small house as white
          as snow.</p>

     <p>"If only I had breath to reach that house," he said to
          himself, "perhaps I should be saved."</p>

     <p>And, without delaying an instant, he recommenced running
          for his life through the wood, and the assassins after him.</p>

     <p>At last, after a desperate race of nearly two hours, he
          arrived quite breathless at the door of the house, and knocked.</p>

     <p>No one answered.</p>

     <p>He knocked again with great violence, for he heard the
          sound of steps approaching him and the heavy panting of his
          persecutors. The same silence.</p>

     <p>Seeing that knocking was useless, he began in desperation
          to kick and pommel the door with all his might. The window
          then opened and a beautiful Child appeared at it. She had
          blue hair and a face as white as a waxen image; her eyes were
          closed and her hands were crossed on her breast. Without
          moving her lips in the least, she said, in a voice that seemed
          to come from the other world:</p>

     <p>"In this house there is no one. They are all dead."</p>

     <p>"Then at least open the door for me yourself," shouted
          Pinocchio, crying and imploring.</p>

     <p>"I am dead also."</p>

     <p>"Dead? Then what are you doing there at the window?"</p>

     <p>"I am waiting for the bier to come to carry me away."</p>

     <p>Having said this she immediately disappeared and the
          window was closed again without the slightest noise.</p>

     <p>"Oh! beautiful Child with blue hair," cried Pinocchio,
          "open the door, for pity's sake! Have compassion on a poor
          boy pursued by assas&mdash;"</p>

     <p>But he could not finish the word, for he felt himself
          seized by the collar and the same two horrible voices said to
          him threateningly:</p>

     <p>"You shall not escape from us again!"</p>

     <p>The puppet, seeing death staring him in the face, was
          taken with such a violent fit of trembling that the joints of
          his wooden legs began to creak, and the sovereigns hidden
          under his tongue to clink.</p>

     <p>"Now, then," demanded the assassins, "will you open your
          mouth&mdash;yes or no? Ah! no answer? Leave it to us: this
          time we will force you to open it!"</p>

     <p>And, drawing out two long, horrid knives as sharp as
          razors, clash!&mdash;they attempted to stab him twice.</p>

     <p>But the puppet, luckily for him, was made of very hard
          wood; the knives therefore broke into a thousand pieces and
          the assassins were left with the handles in their hands, staring
          at each other.</p>

     <p>"I see what we must do," said one of them. "He must
          be hung! let us hang him!"</p>

     <p>"Let us hang him!" repeated the other.</p>

     <p>Without loss of time they tied his arms behind him, passed
          a running noose round his throat, and hung him to the branch
          of a tree called the Big Oak.</p>

     <p>They then sat down on the grass and waited for his last
          struggle. But at the end of three hours the puppet's eyes
          were still open, his mouth closed, and he was kicking more
          than ever.</p>

     <p>Losing patience, they turned to Pinocchio and said in a
          bantering tone:</p>

     <p>"Good-bye till tomorrow. Let us hope that when we return
          you will be polite enough to allow yourself to be found quite
          dead, and with your mouth wide open."</p>

     <p>And they walked off.</p>

     <p>In the meantime a tempestuous northerly wind began to
          blow and roar angrily, and it beat the poor puppet from
          side to side, making him swing violently, like the clatter of
          a bell ringing for a wedding. And the swinging gave him
          atrocious spasms, and the running noose, becoming still tighter
          round his throat, took away his breath.</p>

     <p>Little by little his eyes began to grow dim, but although
          he felt that death was near he still continued to hope that
          some charitable person would come to his assistance before it
          was too late. But when, after waiting and waiting, he found
          that no one came, absolutely no one, then he remembered his
          poor father, and, thinking he was dying, he stammered out:</p>

     <p>"Oh, papa! papa! if only you were here!"</p>

     <p>His breath failed him and he could say no more. He
          shut his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched his legs, gave a long
          shudder, and hung stiff and insensible.</p>

     <h2>THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD RESCUES THE PUPPET</h2>


     <p>While poor Pinocchio, suspended to a branch of the Big
          Oak, was apparently more dead than alive, the beautiful
          Child with blue hair came again to the window. When she
          saw the unhappy puppet hanging by his throat, and dancing
          up and down in the gusts of the north wind, she was moved
          by compassion. Striking her hands together, she gave three
          little claps.</p>

     <p>At this signal there came a sound of the sweep of wings
          flying rapidly and a large Falcon flew on to the window-sill.</p>

     <p>"What are your orders, gracious Fairy?" he asked, inclining
          his beak in sign of reverence.</p>

     <p>"Do you see that puppet dangling from a branch of the
          Big Oak?"</p>

     <p>"I see him."</p>

     <p>"Very well. Fly there at once: with your strong beak
          break the knot that keeps him suspended in the air, and lay
          him gently on the grass at the foot of the tree."</p>

     <p>The Falcon flew away and after two minutes he returned,
          saying:</p>

     <p>"I have done as you commanded."</p>

     <p>"And how did you find him?"</p>

     <p>"To see him he appeared dead, but he cannot really be
          quite dead, for I had no sooner loosened the running noose
          that tightened his throat than, giving a sigh, he muttered in
          a faint voice: 'Now I feel better!'"</p>

     <p>The Fairy then struck her hands together twice and a
          magnificent Poodle appeared, walking upright on his hind
          legs exactly as if he had been a man.</p>

     <p>He was in the full-dress livery of a coachman. On his
          head he had a three-cornered cap braided with gold, his curly
          white wig came down on to his shoulders, he had a chocolate-colored
          waistcoat with diamond buttons, and two large pockets
          to contain the bones that his mistress gave him at dinner.
          He had, besides, a pair of short crimson velvet breeches, silk
          stockings, cut-down shoes, and hanging behind him a species
          of umbrella case made of blue satin, to put his tail into when
          the weather was rainy.</p>

     <p>"Be quick, Medoro, like a good dog!" said the Fairy to
          the Poodle. "Have the most beautiful carriage in my coach-house
          harnessed, and take the road to the wood. When you
          come to the Big Oak you will find a poor puppet stretched
          on the grass half dead. Pick him up gently and lay him flat
          on the cushions of the carriage and bring him here to me. Do
          you understand?"</p>

     <p>The Poodle, to show that he had understood, shook the
          case of blue satin three or four times and ran off like a race-horse.</p>

     <p>Shortly afterwards a beautiful little carriage came out of
          the coach-house. The cushions were stuffed with canary feathers
          and it was lined on the inside with whipped cream, custard
          and vanilla wafers. The little carriage was drawn by a hundred
          pairs of white mice, and the Poodle, seated on the coach-box,
          cracked his whip from side to side like a driver when
          he is afraid that he is behind time.</p>

     <p>Scarcely had a quarter of an hour passed, when the carriage
          returned. The Fairy, who was waiting at the door of
          the house, took the poor puppet in her arms and carried him
          into a little room that was wainscoted with mother-of-pearl.
          She sent at once to summon the most famous doctors in the
          neighborhood.</p>

     <p>They came immediately, one after the other: namely, a
          Crow, an Owl, and a Talking-Cricket.</p>

     <p>"I wish to know from you, gentlemen," said the Fairy,
          "if this unfortunate puppet is alive or dead!"</p>

     <p>At this request the Crow, advancing first, felt Pinocchio's
          pulse; he then felt his nose and then the little toe of his foot:
          and, having done this carefully, he pronounced solemnly the
          following words:</p>

     <p>"To my belief the puppet is already quite dead; but, if
          unfortunately he should not be dead, then it would be a sign
          that he is still alive!"</p>

     <p>"I regret," said the Owl, "to be obliged to contradict the
          Crow, my illustrious friend and colleague; but, in my opinion
          the puppet is still alive; but, if unfortunately he should not
          be alive, then it would be a sign that he is dead indeed!"</p>

     <p>"And you&mdash;have you nothing to say?" asked the Fairy
          of the Talking-Cricket.</p>

     <p>"In my opinion, the wisest thing a prudent doctor can do,
          when he does not know what he is talking about, is to be
          silent. For the rest, that puppet there has a face that is
          not new to me. I have known him for some time!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, who up to that moment had lain immovable,
          like a real piece of wood, was seized with a fit of convulsive
          trembling that shook the whole bed.</p>

     <p>"That puppet there," continued the Talking-Cricket, "is
          a confirmed rogue."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio opened his eyes, but shut them again immediately.</p>

     <p>"He is a ragamuffin, a do-nothing, a vagabond."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio hid his face beneath the clothes.</p>

     <p>"That puppet there is a disobedient son who will make
          his poor father die of a broken heart!"</p>

     <p>At that instant a suffocated sound of sobs and crying
          was heard in the room. Imagine everybody's astonishment
          when, having raised the sheets a little, it was discovered that
          the sounds came from Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"When a dead person cries, it is a sign that he is on
          the road to get well," said the Crow solemnly.</p>

     <p>"I grieve to contradict my illustrious friend and colleague,"
          added the Owl; "but for me, when the dead person cries, it
          is a sign that he is sorry to die."</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO WILL NOT TAKE HIS MEDICINE</h2>


     <p>As soon as the three doctors had left the room the Fairy
          approached Pinocchio and, having touched his forehead,
          she perceived that he was in a high fever.</p>

     <p>She therefore dissolved a certain white powder in half a
          tumbler of water and, offering it to the puppet, she said to
          him lovingly:</p>

     <p>"Drink it and in a few days you will be cured."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio looked at the tumbler, made a wry face, and
          then asked in a plaintive voice:</p>

     <p>"Is it sweet or bitter?"</p>

     <p>"It is bitter, but it will do you good."</p>

     <p>"If it is bitter, I will not take it."</p>

     <p>"Listen to me: drink it."</p>

     <p>"I don't like anything bitter."</p>

     <p>"Drink it, and when you have drunk it I will give you
          a lump of sugar to take away the taste."</p>

     <p>"Where is the lump of sugar?"</p>

     <p>"Here it is," said the Fairy, taking a piece from a gold
          sugar-basin.</p>

     <p>"Give me first the lump of sugar and then I will drink
          that bad bitter water."</p>

     <p>"Do you promise me?"</p>

     <p>"Yes."</p>

     <p>The Fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio, having
          crunched it up and swallowed it in a second, said, licking
          his lips:</p>

     <p>"It would be a fine thing if sugar were medicine! I
          would take it every day."</p>

     <p>"Now keep your promise and drink these few drops of
          water, which will restore you to health."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio took the tumbler unwillingly in his hand and
          put the point of his nose to it: he then approached it to his
          lips: he then again put his nose to it, and at last said:</p>

     <p>"It is too bitter! too bitter! I cannot drink it."</p>

     <p>"How can you tell that, when you have not even tasted it?"</p>

     <p>"I can imagine it! I know it from the smell. I want
          first another lump of sugar and then I will drink it!"</p>

     <p>The Fairy then, with all the patience of a good mamma,
          put another lump of sugar in his mouth, and again presented
          the tumbler to him.</p>

     <p>"I cannot drink it so!" said the puppet, making a thousand
          grimaces.</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because that pillow that is down there on my feet
          bothers me."</p>

     <p>The Fairy removed the pillow.</p>

     <p>"It is useless. Even so I cannot drink it."</p>

     <p>"What is the matter now?"</p>

     <p>"The door of the room, which is half open, bothers me."</p>

     <p>The Fairy went and closed the door.</p>

     <p>"In short," cried Pinocchio, bursting into tears, "I will
          not drink that bitter water&mdash;no, no, no!"</p>

     <p>"My boy, you will repent it."</p>

     <p>"I don't care."</p>

     <p>"Your illness is serious."</p>

     <p>"I don't care."</p>

     <p>"The fever in a few hours will carry you into the other
          world."</p>

     <p>"I don't care."</p>

     <p>"Are you not afraid of death?"</p>

     <p>"I am not in the least afraid! I would rather die than
          drink that bitter medicine."</p>

     <p>At that moment the door of the room flew open and
          four rabbits as black as ink entered carrying on their shoulders
          a little bier.</p>

     <p>"What do you want with me?" cried Pinocchio, sitting
          up in bed in a great fright.</p>

     <p>"We have come to take you," said the biggest rabbit.</p>

     <p>"To take me? But I am not yet dead!"</p>

     <p>"No, not yet? but you have only a few minutes to live,
          as you have refused the medicine that would have cured you
          of the fever."</p>

     <p>"Oh, Fairy, Fairy!" the puppet then began to scream,
          "give me the tumbler at once; be quick, for pity's sake, for
          I will not die&mdash;no, I will not die."</p>

     <p>And, taking the tumbler in both hands, he emptied it
          at a gulp.</p>

     <p>"We must have patience!" said the rabbits; "this time
          we have made our journey in vain." And, taking the little
          bier again on their shoulders, they left the room, grumbling
          and murmuring between their teeth.</p>

     <p>In fact, a few minutes afterwards, Pinocchio jumped down
          from the bed quite well, because wooden puppets have the
          privilege of being seldom ill and of being cured very quickly.</p>

     <p>The Fairy, seeing him running and rushing about the room
          as gay and as lively as a young cock, said to him:</p>

     <p>"Then my medicine has really done you good?"</p>

     <p>"Good? I should think so! It has restored me to life!"</p>

     <p>"Then why on earth did you require so much persuasion
          to take it?"</p>

     <p>"Because you see that we boys are all like that! We
          are more afraid of medicine than of the illness."</p>

     <p>"Disgraceful! Boys ought to know that a good remedy
          taken in time may save them from a serious illness, and perhaps
          even from death."</p>

     <p>"Oh! but another time I shall not require so much persuasion.
          I shall remember those black rabbits with the bier
          on their shoulders and then I shall immediately take the
          tumbler in my hand, and down it will go!"</p>

     <p>"Now, come here to me and tell me how it came about
          that you fell into the hands of those assassins."</p>

     <p>"You see, the showman, Fire-Eater, gave me some gold
          pieces and said to me: 'Go, and take them to your father!'
          and instead I met on the road a Fox and a Cat, who said
          to me: 'Would you like those pieces of gold to become a
          thousand or two? Come with us and we will take you to
          the Field of Miracles,' and I said: 'Let us go.' And they
          said: 'Let us stop at the inn of The Red Craw-Fish,' and after
          midnight they left. And when I awoke I found that they
          were no longer there, because they had gone away. Then I
          began to travel by night, for you cannot imagine how dark
          it was; and on that account I met on the road two assassins
          in charcoal sacks who said to me: 'Out with your money,' and
          I said to them: 'I have got none,' because I had hidden the
          four gold pieces in my mouth, and one of the assassins tried
          to put his hand in my mouth, and I bit his hand off and spat
          it out, but instead of a hand it was a cat's paw. And the
          assassins ran after me, and I ran, and ran, until at last they
          caught me and tied me by the neck to a tree in this wood, and
          said to me: 'Tomorrow we shall return here and then you
          will be dead with your mouth open and we shall be able to
          carry off the pieces of gold that you have hidden under your
          tongue."</p>

     <p>"And the four pieces&mdash;where have you put them?" asked
          the Fairy.</p>

     <p>"I have lost them!" said Pinocchio, but he was telling a
          lie, for he had them in his pocket.</p>

     <p>He had scarcely told the lie when his nose, which was
          already long, grew at once two inches longer.</p>

     <p>"And where did you lose them?"</p>

     <p>"In the wood near here."</p>

     <p>At this second lie his nose went on growing.</p>

     <p>"If you have lost them in the wood near here," said the
          Fairy, "we will look for them and we shall find them: because
          everything that is lost in that wood is always found."</p>

     <p>"Ah! now I remember all about it," replied the puppet,
          getting quite confused; "I didn't lose the four gold pieces, I
          swallowed them whilst I was drinking your medicine."</p>

     <p>At this lie his nose grew to such an extraordinary length
          that poor Pinocchio could not move in any direction. If he
          turned to one side he struck his nose against the bed or the
          window-panes, if he turned to the other he struck it against
          the walls or the door, if he raised his head a little he ran the
          risk of sticking it into one of the Fairy's eyes.</p>

     <p>And the Fairy looked at him and laughed.</p>

     <p>"What are you laughing at?" asked the puppet, very
          confused and anxious at finding his nose growing so prodigiously.</p>

     <p>"I am laughing at the lie you have told."</p>

     <p>"And how can you possibly know that I have told a lie?"</p>

     <p>"Lies, my dear boy, are found out immediately, because
          they are of two sorts. There are lies that have short legs,
          and lies that have long noses. Your lie, as it happens, is one
          of those that have a long nose."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, not knowing where to hide himself for shame,
          tried to run out of the room; but he did not succeed, for his
          nose had increased so much that it could no longer pass through
          the door.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO AGAIN MEETS THE FOX AND THE CAT</h2>


     <p>The Fairy allowed the puppet to cry for a good half-hour
          over his nose, which could no longer pass through the
          door of the room. This she did to give him a severe lesson,
          and to correct him of the disgraceful fault of telling lies&mdash;the
          most disgraceful fault that a boy can have. But when
          she saw him quite disfigured and his eyes swollen out of his
          head from weeping, she felt full of compassion for him. She
          therefore beat her hands together and at that signal a thousand
          large birds called Woodpeckers flew in at the window.
          They immediately perched on Pinocchio's nose and began to
          peck at it with such zeal that in a few minutes his enormous
          and ridiculous nose was reduced to its usual dimensions.</p>

     <p>"What a good Fairy you are," said the puppet, drying
          his eyes, "and how much I love you!"</p>

     <p>"I love you also," answered the Fairy; "and if you will
          remain with me you shall be my little brother and I will be
          your good little sister."</p>

     <p>"I would remain willingly if it were not for my poor papa."</p>

     <p>"I have thought of everything. I have already let your
          father know, and he will be here tonight."</p>

     <p>"Really?" shouted Pinocchio, jumping for joy. "Then,
          little Fairy, if you consent, I should like to go and meet
          him. I am so anxious to give a kiss to that poor old man,
          who has suffered so much on my account, that I am counting
          the minutes."</p>

     <p>"Go, then, but be careful not to lose yourself. Take the
          road through the wood and I am sure that you will meet him."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio set out, and as soon as he was in the wood he
          began to run like a kid. But when he had reached a certain
          spot, almost in front of the Big Oak, he stopped, because he
          thought he heard people amongst the bushes. In fact, two
          persons came out on to the road. Can you guess who they
          were? His two traveling companions, the Fox and the Cat,
          with whom he had supped at the inn of The Red Craw-Fish.</p>

     <p>"Why, here is our dear Pinocchio!" cried the Fox, kissing
          and embracing him. "How came you to be here?"</p>

     <p>"How come you to be here?" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"It is a long story," answered the puppet, "which I will
          tell you when I have time. But do you know that the other
          night, when you left me alone at the inn, I met with assassins
          on the road?"</p>

     <p>"Assassins! Oh, poor Pinocchio! And what did they want?"</p>

     <p>"They wanted to rob me of my gold pieces."</p>

     <p>"Villains!" said the Fox.</p>

     <p>"Infamous villains!" repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"But I ran away from them," continued the puppet, "and
          they followed me, and at last they overtook me and hung
          me to a branch of that oak tree."</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio pointed to the Big Oak, which was two
          steps from them.</p>

     <p>"Is it possible to hear of anything more dreadful?" said
          the Fox. "In what a world we are condemned to live! Where
          can respectable people like us find a safe refuge?"</p>

     <p>Whilst they were thus talking Pinocchio observed that
          the Cat was lame of her front right leg, for in fact she had
          lost her paw with all its claws. He therefore asked her:</p>

     <p>"What have you done with your paw?"</p>

     <p>The Cat tried to answer, but became confused. Therefore
          the Fox said immediately:</p>

     <p>"My friend is too modest, and that is why she doesn't
          speak. I will answer for her. I must tell you that an hour
          ago we met an old wolf on the road, almost fainting from
          want of food, who asked alms of us. Not having so much as
          a fish-bone to give him, what did my friend, who has really
          the heart of a C&aelig;sar, do? She bit off one of her fore paws
          and threw it to that poor beast that he might appease his
          hunger."</p>

     <p>And the Fox, in relating this, dried a tear.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio was also touched and, approaching the Cat, he
          whispered into her ear:</p>

     <p>"If all cats resembled you, how fortunate the mice would
          be!"</p>

     <p>"And now, what are you doing here?" asked the Fox of
          the puppet.</p>

     <p>"I am waiting for my papa, whom I expect to arrive every
          moment."</p>

     <p>"And your gold pieces?"</p>

     <p>"I have got them in my pocket, all but one that I spent
          at the inn of The Red Craw-Fish."</p>

     <p>"And to think that, instead of four pieces, by tomorrow
          they might become one or two thousand! Why do you not
          listen to my advice? Why will you not go and bury them in
          the Field of Miracles?"</p>

     <p>"Today it is impossible; I will go another day."</p>

     <p>"Another day it will be too late!" said the Fox.</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because the field has been bought by a gentleman and
          after tomorrow no one will be allowed to bury money there."</p>

     <p>"How far off is the Field of Miracles?"</p>

     <p>"Not two miles. Will you come with us? In half an
          hour you will be there. You can bury your money at once,
          and in a few minutes you will collect two thousand, and this
          evening you will return with your pockets full. Will you
          come with us?"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio thought of the good Fairy, old Geppetto, and
          the warnings of the Talking-Cricket, and he hesitated a little
          before answering. He ended, however, by doing as all boys
          do who have not a grain of sense and who have no heart&mdash;he
          ended by giving his head a little shake and saying to the
          Fox and the Cat:</p>

     <p>"Let us go: I will come with you."</p>

     <p>And they went.</p>

     <p>After having walked half the day they reached a town
          that was called "Trap for Blockheads." As soon as Pinocchio
          entered this town he saw that the streets were crowded with
          dogs who were yawning from hunger, shorn sheep trembling
          with cold, cocks without combs begging for a grain of Indian
          corn, large butterflies that could no longer fly because they
          had sold their beautiful colored wings, peacocks which had no
          tails and were ashamed to be seen, and pheasants that went
          scratching about in a subdued fashion, mourning for their brilliant
          gold and silver feathers gone forever.</p>

     <p>In the midst of this crowd of beggars and shamefaced
          creatures some lordly carriage passed from time to time containing
          a Fox, or a thieving Magpie, or some other ravenous
          bird of prey.</p>

     <p>"And where is the Field of Miracles?" asked Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"It is here, not two steps from us."</p>

     <p>They crossed the town and, having gone beyond the walls,
          they came to a solitary field.</p>

     <p>"Here we are," said the Fox to the puppet. "Now stoop
          down and dig with your hands a little hole in the ground and
          put your gold pieces into it."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio obeyed. He dug a hole, put into it the four
          gold pieces that he had left, and then filled up the hole with
          a little earth.</p>

     <p>"Now, then," said the Fox, "go to that canal close to us,
          fetch a can of water, and water the ground where you have
          sowed them."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio went to the canal, and, as he had no can, he
          took off one of his old shoes and filling it with water he watered
          the ground over the hole.</p>

     <p>He then asked:</p>

     <p>"Is there anything else to be done?"</p>

     <p>"Nothing else," answered the Fox. "We can now go
          away. You can return in about twenty minutes and you will
          find a shrub already pushing through the ground, with its
          branches quite loaded with money."</p>

     <p>The poor puppet, beside himself with joy, thanked the
          Fox and the Cat a thousand times, and promised them a beautiful
          present.</p>

     <p>"We wish for no presents," answered the two rascals. "It
          is enough for us to have taught you the way to enrich yourself
          without undergoing hard work, and we are as happy as people
          out for a holiday."</p>

     <p>Thus saying, they took leave of Pinocchio, and, wishing
          him a good harvest, went about their business.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED OF HIS MONEY</h2>


     <p>The puppet returned to the town and began to count the
          minutes one by one, and when he thought that it must
          be time he took the road leading to the Field of Miracles.</p>

     <p>And as he walked along with hurried steps his heart beat
          fast&mdash;tic, tac, tic, tac&mdash;like a drawing-room clock when it is
          really going well. Meanwhile he was thinking to himself:</p>

     <p>"And if, instead of a thousand gold pieces, I were to find
          on the branches of the tree two thousand? And instead of
          two thousand, supposing I found five thousand? and instead
          of five thousand, that I found a hundred thousand? Oh! what
          a fine gentleman I should then become! I would have a beautiful
          palace, a thousand little wooden horses and a thousand
          stables to amuse myself with, a cellar full of currant wine and
          sweet syrups, and a library quite full of candies, tarts, plum-cakes,
          macaroons, and biscuits with cream."</p>

     <p>Whilst he was building these castles in the air he had
          arrived in the neighborhood of the field, and he stopped to look
          about for a tree with its branches laden with money, but he
          saw nothing. He advanced another hundred steps&mdash;nothing;
          he entered the field and went right up to the little hole where
          he had buried his sovereigns&mdash;and nothing. He then became
          very thoughtful and, forgetting the rules of society and good
          manners, he took his hands out of his pocket and gave his head
          a long scratch.</p>

     <p>At that moment he heard an explosion of laughter close
          to him and, looking up, he saw a large Parrot perched on a
          tree, who was pruning the few feathers he had left.</p>

     <p>"Why are you laughing?" asked Pinocchio in an angry
          voice.</p>

     <p>"I am laughing because in pruning my feathers I tickled
          myself under my wings."</p>

     <p>The puppet did not answer, but went to the canal and,
          filling the same old shoe full of water, he proceeded to water
          the earth afresh that covered his gold pieces.</p>

     <p>While he was thus occupied another laugh, still more impertinent
          than the first, rang out in the silence of that solitary
          place.</p>

     <p>"Once for all," shouted Pinocchio in a rage, "may I know,
          you ill-educated Parrot, what you are laughing at?"</p>

     <p>"I am laughing at those simpletons who believe in all the
          foolish things that are told them, and who allow themselves
          to be entrapped by those who are more cunning than they are."</p>

     <p>"Are you perhaps speaking of me?"</p>

     <p>"Yes, I am speaking of you, poor Pinocchio&mdash;of you who
          are simple enough to believe that money can be sown and
          gathered in fields in the same way as beans and gourds. I
          also believed it once and today I am suffering for it. Today&mdash;but
          it is too late&mdash;I have at last learned that to put a few
          pennies honestly together it is necessary to know how to earn
          them, either by the work of our own hands or by the cleverness
          of our own brains."</p>

     <p>"I don't understand you," said the puppet, who was
          already trembling with fear.</p>

     <p>"Have patience! I will explain myself better," rejoined
          the Parrot. "You must know, then, that while you were in
          the town the Fox and the Cat returned to the field; they took
          the buried money and then fled like the wind. And now he
          that catches them will be clever."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio remained with his mouth open and, not choosing
          to believe the Parrot's words, he began with his hands and
          nails to dig up the earth that he had watered. And he dug,
          and dug, and dug, and made such a deep hole that a rick of
          straw might have stood upright in it, but the money was no
          longer there.</p>

     <p>He rushed back to the town in a state of desperation and
          went at once to the Courts of Justice to denounce the two
          knaves who had robbed him to the judge.</p>

     <p>The judge was a big ape of the gorilla tribe, an old ape
          respectable for his age, his white beard, but especially for his
          gold spectacles without glasses that he was always obliged to
          wear, on account of an inflammation of the eyes that had
          tormented him for many years.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio related in the presence of the judge all the
          particulars of the infamous fraud of which he had been the
          victim. He gave the names, the surnames, and other details,
          of the two rascals, and ended by demanding justice.</p>

     <p>The judge listened with great benignity; took a lively
          interest in the story; was much touched and moved; and when
          the puppet had nothing further to say he stretched out his
          hand and rang a bell.</p>

     <p>At this summons two mastiffs immediately appeared dressed
          as gendarmes. The judge then, pointing to Pinocchio, said
          to them:</p>

     <p>"That poor devil has been robbed of four gold pieces; take
          him away and put him immediately into prison."</p>

     <p>The puppet was petrified on hearing this unexpected sentence
          and tried to protest; but the gendarmes, to avoid losing
          time, stopped his mouth and carried him off to the lockup.</p>

     <p>And there he remained for four months&mdash;four long months&mdash;and
          he would have remained longer still if a fortunate chance
          had not released him. The young Emperor who reigned over
          the town of "Trap for Blockheads," having won a splendid
          victory over his enemies, ordered great public rejoicings. There
          were illuminations, fireworks, horse races and velocipede races,
          and as a further sign of triumph he commanded that the prisons
          should be opened and all the prisoners freed.</p>

     <p>"If the others are to be let out of prison, I will go also,"
          said Pinocchio to the jailor.</p>

     <p>"No, not you," said the jailor, "because you do not belong
          to the fortunate class."</p>

     <p>"I beg your pardon," replied Pinocchio, "I am also a
          criminal."</p>

     <p>"In that case you are perfectly right," said the jailor, and,
          taking off his hat and bowing to him respectfully, he opened
          the prison doors and let him escape.</p>

     <h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h3>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO STARTS BACK TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE</h2>


     <p>You can imagine Pinocchio's joy when he found himself
          free. Without stopping to take breath he immediately
          left the town and took the road that led to the Fairy's house.</p>

     <p>On account of the rainy weather the road had become a
          marsh into which he sank knee-deep. But the puppet would
          not give in. Tormented by the desire of seeing his father and
          his little sister with blue hair again, he ran on like a greyhound,
          and as he ran he was splashed with mud from head to
          foot. And he said to himself as he went along: "How many
          misfortunes have happened to me. But I deserved them, for
          I am an obstinate, passionate puppet. I am always bent upon
          having my own way, without listening to those who wish me
          well, and who have a thousand times more sense than I have!
          But from this time forth I am determined to change and to
          become orderly and obedient. For at last I have seen that
          disobedient boys come to no good and gain nothing. And
          has my papa waited for me? Shall I find him at the Fairy's
          house? Poor man, it is so long since I last saw him: I am
          dying to embrace him and to cover him with kisses! And will
          the Fairy forgive me my bad conduct to her? To think of
          all the kindness and loving care I received from her, to think
          that if I am now alive I owe it to her! Would it be possible
          to find a more ungrateful boy, or one with less heart than
          I have?"</p>

     <p>Whilst he was saying this he stopped suddenly, frightened
          to death, and made four steps backwards.</p>

     <p>What had he seen?</p>

     <p>He had seen an immense Serpent stretched across the
          road. Its skin was green, it had red eyes, and a pointed tail
          that was smoking like a chimney.</p>

     <p>It would be impossible to imagine the puppet's terror. He
          walked away to a safe distance and, sitting down on a heap
          of stones, waited until the Serpent should have gone about its
          business and left the road clear.</p>

     <p>He waited an hour; two hours; three hours; but the Serpent
          was always there, and even from a distance he could see
          the red light of his fiery eyes and the column of smoke that
          ascended from the end of his tail.</p>

     <p>At last Pinocchio, trying to feel courageous, approached
          to within a few steps, and said to the Serpent in a little soft,
          insinuating voice:</p>

     <p>"Excuse me. Sir Serpent, but would you be so good as
          to move a little to one side&mdash;just enough to allow me to pass?"</p>

     <p>He might as well have spoken to the wall. Nobody moved.</p>

     <p>He began again in the same soft voice:</p>

     <p>"You must know. Sir Serpent, that I am on my way
          home, where my father is waiting for me, and it is such a
          long time since I saw him last! Will you, therefore, allow
          me to continue my road?"</p>

     <p>He waited for a sign in answer to this request, but there
          was none; in fact, the Serpent, who up to that moment had
          been sprightly and full of life, became motionless and almost
          rigid. He shut his eyes and his tail ceased smoking.</p>

     <p>"Can he really be dead?" said Pinocchio, rubbing his hands
          with delight. He determined to jump over him and reach the
          other side of the road. But, just as he was going to leap, the
          Serpent raised himself suddenly on end, like a spring set in
          motion; and the puppet, drawing back, in his terror caught his
          feet and fell to the ground.</p>

     <p>And he fell so awkwardly that his head stuck in the mud
          and his legs went into the air.</p>

     <p>At the sight of the puppet kicking violently with his head
          in the mud, the Serpent went into convulsions of laughter, and
          laughed, and laughed, until he broke a blood-vessel in his chest
          and died. And that time he was really dead.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio then set off running, in hopes that he should
          reach the Fairy's house before dark. But before long he began
          to suffer so dreadfully from hunger that he could not bear
          it, and he jumped into a field by the wayside, intending to
          pick some bunches of Muscatel grapes. Oh, that he had never
          done it!</p>

     <p>He had scarcely reached the vines when crack&mdash;his legs
          were caught between two cutting iron bars and he became so
          giddy with pain that stars of every color danced before his eyes.</p>

     <p>The poor puppet had been taken in a trap put there to
          capture some big polecats which were the scourge of the poultry-yards
          in the neighborhood.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO ACTS AS WATCH-DOG</h2>


     <p>Pinocchio began to cry and scream, but his tears and
          groans were useless, for there was not a house to be seen,
          and not a living soul passed down the road.</p>

     <p>At last night came on.</p>

     <p>Partly from the pain of the trap, that cut his legs, and
          a little from fear at finding himself alone in the dark in the
          midst of the fields, the puppet was on the point of fainting.
          Just at that moment he saw a Firefly flitting over his head.
          He called to it and said:</p>

     <p>"Oh, little Firefly, will you have pity on me and liberate
          me from this torture?"</p>

     <p>"Poor boy!" said the Firefly, stopping and looking at
          him with compassion; "but how could your legs have been
          caught by those sharp irons?"</p>

     <p>"I came into the field to pick two bunches of these Muscatel
          grapes, and&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"But were the grapes yours?"</p>

     <p>"No."</p>

     <p>"Then who taught you to carry off other people's property?"</p>

     <p>"I was so hungry."</p>

     <p>"Hunger, my boy, is not a good reason for appropriating
          what does not belong to us."</p>

     <p>"That is true, that is true!" said Pinocchio, crying. "I
          will never do it again."</p>

     <p>At this moment their conversation was interrupted by a
          slight sound of approaching footsteps. It was the owner of
          the field coming on tiptoe to see if one of the polecats that
          ate his chickens during the night had been caught in his trap.</p>

     <p>His astonishment was great when, having brought out his
          lantern from under his coat, he perceived that instead of a
          polecat a boy had been taken.</p>

     <p>"Ah, little thief," said the angry peasant, "then it is you
          who carries off my chickens?"</p>

     <p>"No, it is not I; indeed it is not!" cried Pinocchio, sobbing.
          "I only came into the field to take two bunches of
          grapes!"</p>

     <p>"He who steals grapes is quite capable of stealing chickens.
          Leave it to me, I will give you a lesson that you will not
          forget in a hurry."</p>

     <p>Opening the trap, he seized the puppet by the collar and
          carried him to his house as if he had been a young lamb.</p>

     <p>When he reached the yard in front of the house he threw
          him roughly on the ground and, putting his foot on his neck,
          he said to him:</p>

     <p>"It is late and I want to go to bed; we will settle our
          accounts tomorrow. In the meanwhile, as the dog who kept
          guard at night died today, you shall take his place at once.
          You shall be my watch-dog."</p>

     <p>And, taking a great collar covered with brass knobs, he
          strapped it so tightly round his throat that he was not able
          to draw his head out of it. A heavy chain attached to the
          collar was fastened to the wall.</p>

     <p>"If it should rain tonight," he then said to him, "you can
          go and lie down in the kennel; the straw that has served as a
          bed for my poor dog for the last four years is still there. If
          unfortunately robbers should come, remember to keep your
          ears pricked and to bark."</p>

     <p>After giving him this last injunction the man went into
          the house, shut the door, and put up the chain.</p>

     <p>Poor Pinocchio remained lying on the ground more dead
          than alive from the effects of cold, hunger and fear. From
          time to time he put his hands angrily to the collar that tightened
          his throat and said, crying:</p>

     <p>"It serves me right! Decidedly, it serves me right! I
          was determined to be a vagabond and a good-for-nothing. I
          would listen to bad companions, and that is why I always meet
          with misfortunes. If I had been a good little boy, as so many
          are; if I had remained at home with my poor papa, I should
          not now be in the midst of the fields and obliged to be the
          watch-dog to a peasant's house. Oh, if I could be born again!
          But now it is too late and I must have patience!"</p>

     <p>Relieved by this little outburst, which came straight from
          his heart, he went into the dog-kennel and fell asleep.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO DISCOVERS THE ROBBERS</h2>


     <p>He had been sleeping heavily for about two hours when,
          towards midnight, he was aroused by a whispering of
          strange voices that seemed to come from the courtyard. Putting
          the point of his nose out of the kennel, he saw four little
          beasts with dark fur, that looked like cats, standing consulting
          together. But they were not cats; they were polecats&mdash;carnivorous
          little animals, especially greedy for eggs and young
          chickens. One of the polecats, leaving his companions, came
          to the opening of the kennel and said in a low voice:</p>

     <p>"Good evening, Melampo."</p>

     <p>"My name is not Melampo," answered the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Oh! then who are you?"</p>

     <p>"I am Pinocchio."</p>

     <p>"And what are you doing here?"</p>

     <p>"I am acting as watch-dog."</p>

     <p>"Then where is Melampo? Where is the old dog who
          lived in this kennel?"</p>

     <p>"He died this morning."</p>

     <p>"Is he dead? Poor beast! He was so good. But, judging
          you by your face, I should say that you were also a
          good dog."</p>

     <p>"I beg your pardon, I am not a dog."</p>

     <p>"Not a dog? Then what are you?"</p>

     <p>"I am a puppet."</p>

     <p>"And you are acting as watch-dog?"</p>

     <p>"That is only too true&mdash;as a punishment."</p>

     <p>"Well, then, I will offer you the same conditions that
          we made with the deceased Melampo, and I am sure you will
          be satisfied with them."</p>

     <p>"What are these conditions?"</p>

     <p>"One night in every week you are to permit us to visit
          this poultry-yard as we have hitherto done, and to carry off
          eight chickens. Of these chickens seven are to be eaten by
          us, and one we will give to you, on the express understanding,
          however, that you pretend to be asleep, and that it never
          enters your head to bark and to waken the peasant."</p>

     <p>"Did Melampo act in this manner?" asked Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Certainly, and we were always on the best terms with
          him. Sleep quietly, and rest assured that before we go we
          will leave by the kennel a beautiful chicken ready plucked for
          your breakfast tomorrow. Have we understood each other
          clearly?"</p>

     <p>"Only too clearly!" answered Pinocchio, and he shook his
          head threateningly, as much as to say: "You shall hear of
          this shortly!"</p>

     <p>The four polecats, thinking themselves safe, repaired to
          the poultry-yard, which was close to the kennel, and, having
          opened the wooden gate with their teeth and claws, they slipped
          in one by one. But they had only just passed through when
          they heard the gate shut behind them with great violence.</p>

     <p>It was Pinocchio who had shut it, and for greater security
          he put a large stone against it to keep it closed.</p>

     <p>He then began to bark, and he barked exactly like a
          watch-dog: "Bow-wow, bow-wow."</p>

     <p>Hearing the barking, the peasant jumped out of bed and,
          taking his gun, he came to the window and asked:</p>

     <p>"What is the matter?"</p>

     <p>"There are robbers!" answered Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Where are they?"</p>

     <p>"In the poultry-yard."</p>

     <p>"I will come down directly."</p>

     <p>In fact, in less time than it takes to say "Amen!" the
          peasant came down. He rushed into the poultry-yard, caught
          the polecats, and, having put them into a sack, he said to
          them in a tone of great satisfaction:</p>

     <p>"At last you have fallen into my hands! I might punish
          you, but I am not so cruel. I will content myself instead by
          carrying you in the morning to the innkeeper of the neighboring
          village, who will skin and cook you as hares with a sweet
          and sour sauce. It is an honor that you don't deserve, but
          generous people like me don't consider such trifles!"</p>

     <p>He then approached Pinocchio and began to caress him,
          and amongst other things he asked him:</p>

     <p>"How did you manage to discover the four thieves? To
          think that Melampo, my faithful Melampo, never found out
          anything!"</p>

     <p>The puppet might then have told him the whole story;
          he might have informed him of the disgraceful conditions that
          had been made between the dog and the polecats; but he remembered
          that the dog was dead and he thought to himself:</p>

     <p>"What is the good of accusing the dead? The dead are
          dead, and the best thing to be done is to leave them in peace!"</p>

     <p>"When the thieves got into the yard, were you asleep or
          awake?" the peasant went on to ask him.</p>

     <p>"I was asleep," answered Pinocchio, "but the polecats woke
          me with their chatter and one of them came to the kennel and
          said to me: 'If you promise not to bark, and not to wake the
          master, we will make you a present of a fine chicken ready
          plucked!' To think that they should have had the audacity
          to make such a proposal to me! For, although I am a puppet,
          possessing perhaps nearly all the faults in the world, there is
          one that I certainly will never be guilty of, that of making
          terms with, and sharing the gains of, dishonest people!"</p>

     <p>"Well said, my boy!" cried the peasant, slapping him on
          the shoulder. "Such sentiments do you honor; and as a proof
          of my gratitude I will at once set you at liberty, and you may
          return home."</p>

     <p>And he removed the dog-collar.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO FLIES TO THE SEASHORE</h2>


     <p>As soon as Pinocchio was released from the heavy and humiliating
          weight of the dog-collar he started off across the
          fields and never stopped until he had reached the high road
          that led to the Fairy's house. He could see amongst the trees
          the top of the Big Oak to which he had been hung, but, although
          he looked in every direction, the little house belonging to the
          beautiful Child with the blue hair was nowhere visible.</p>

     <p>Seized with a sad presentiment, he began to run with all
          the strength he had left and in a few minutes he reached the
          field where the little white house had once stood. But it was
          no longer there. Instead of the house he saw a marble stone,
          on which were engraved these sad words:</p>

     <p class="center"> HERE LIES<br />
          THE CHILD WITH THE BLUE HAIR<br />
          WHO DIED FROM SORROW<br />
          BECAUSE SHE WAS ABANDONED BY HER<br />
          LITTLE BROTHER PINOCCHIO</p>

     <p>I leave you to imagine the puppet's feelings when he had
          with difficulty spelled out this epitaph. He fell with his face
          on the ground and, covering the tombstone with a thousand
          kisses, burst into an agony of tears. He cried all night and
          when morning came he was still crying, although he had no
          tears left, and his sobs and lamentations were so acute and
          heart-breaking that they aroused the echoes in the surrounding
          hills.</p>

     <p>And as he wept he said:</p>

     <p>"Oh, little Fairy, why did you die? Why did I not die
          instead of you, I who am so wicked, whilst you were so good?
          And my papa? Where can he be? Oh, little Fairy, tell me
          where I can find him, for I want to remain with him always
          and never leave him again, never again! Oh, little Fairy, tell
          me that it is not true that you are dead! If you really love
          your little brother, come to life again. Does it not grieve
          you to see me alone and abandoned by everybody? If assassins
          come they will hang me again to the branch of a tree, and
          then I should die indeed. What do you imagine that I can
          do here alone in the world? Now that I have lost you and
          my papa, who will give me food? Where shall I go to sleep
          at night? Who will make me a new jacket? Oh, it would
          be better, a hundred times better, for me to die also! Yes,
          I want to die&mdash;oh! oh! oh!"</p>

     <p>And in his despair he tried to tear his hair, but his hair
          was made of wood so he could not even have the satisfaction
          of sticking his fingers into it.</p>

     <p>Just then a large Pigeon flew over his head and, stopping
          with distended wings, called down to him from a great height:</p>

     <p>"Tell me, child, what are you doing there?"</p>

     <p>"Don't you see? I am crying!" said Pinocchio, raising
          his head towards the voice and rubbing his eyes with his jacket.</p>

     <p>"Tell me," continued the Pigeon, "amongst your companions,
          do you happen to know a puppet who is called Pinocchio?"</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio? Did you say Pinocchio?" repeated the puppet,
          jumping quickly to his feet. "I am Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>At this answer the Pigeon descended rapidly to the ground.
          He was larger than a turkey.</p>

     <p>"Do you also know Geppetto?" he asked.</p>

     <p>"Do I know him! He is my poor papa! Has he perhaps
          spoken to you of me? Will you take me to him? Is he still
          alive? Answer me, for pity's sake: is he still alive?"</p>

     <p>"I left him three days ago on the seashore."</p>

     <p>"What was he doing?"</p>

     <p>"He was building a little boat for himself, to cross the
          ocean. For more than three months that poor man has been
          going all round the world looking for you. Not having succeeded
          in finding you, he has now taken it into his head to go
          to the distant countries of the New World in search of you."</p>

     <p>"How far is it from here to the shore?" asked Pinocchio
          breathlessly.</p>

     <p>"More than six hundred miles."</p>

     <p>"Six hundred miles? Oh, beautiful Pigeon, what a fine
          thing it would be to have your wings!"</p>

     <p>"If you wish to go, I will carry you there."</p>

     <p>"How?"</p>

     <p>"On my back. Do you weigh much?"</p>

     <p>"I weigh next to nothing. I am as light as a feather."</p>

     <p>And without waiting for more Pinocchio jumped at once
          on the Pigeon's back and, putting a leg on each side of him
          as men do on horseback, he exclaimed joyfully:</p>

     <p>"Gallop, gallop, my little horse, for I am anxious to arrive
          quickly!"</p>

     <p>The Pigeon took flight and in a few minutes had soared
          so high that they almost touched the clouds. Finding himself
          at such an immense height the puppet had the curiosity to turn
          and look down; but his head spun round and he became so
          frightened to save himself from the danger of falling he wound
          his arms tightly round the neck of his feathered steed.</p>

     <p>They flew all day. Towards evening the Pigeon said:</p>

     <p>"I am very thirsty!"</p>

     <p>"And I am very hungry!" rejoined Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Let us stop at that dovecote for a few minutes and then
          we will continue our journey, so that we may reach the seashore
          by dawn tomorrow."</p>

     <p>They went into a deserted dovecote, where they found
          nothing but a basin full of water and a basket full of vetch.</p>

     <p>The puppet had never in his life been able to eat vetch:
          according to him it made him sick. That evening, however,
          he ate to repletion, and when he had nearly emptied the basket
          he turned to the Pigeon and said to him:</p>

     <p>"I never could have believed that vetch was so good!"</p>

     <p>"Be assured, my boy," replied the Pigeon, "that when
          hunger is real, and there is nothing else to eat, even vetch
          becomes delicious. Hunger knows neither caprice nor greediness."</p>

     <p>Having quickly finished their little meal they recommenced
          their journey and flew away. The following morning they
          reached the seashore.</p>

     <p>The Pigeon placed Pinocchio on the ground and, not wishing
          to be troubled with thanks for having done a good action,
          flew quickly away and disappeared.</p>

     <p>The shore was crowded with people who were looking
          out to sea, shouting and gesticulating.</p>

     <p>"What has happened?" asked Pinocchio of an old woman.</p>

     <p>"A poor father who has lost his son has gone away in a
          boat to search for him on the other side of the water, and
          today the sea is tempestuous and the little boat is in danger
          of sinking."</p>

     <p>"Where is the little boat?"</p>

     <p>"It is out there in a line with my finger," said the old
          woman, pointing to a little boat which, seen at that distance,
          looked like a nutshell with a very little man in it.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio fixed his eyes on it and after looking attentively
          he gave a piercing scream, crying:</p>

     <p>"It is my papa! It is my papa!"</p>

     <p>The boat, meanwhile, beaten by the fury of the waves, at
          one moment disappeared in the trough of the sea, and the next
          came again to the surface. Pinocchio, standing on the top of
          a high rock, kept calling to his father by name, and making
          every kind of signal to him with his hands, his handkerchief,
          and his cap.</p>

     <p>And, although he was so far off, Geppetto appeared to
          recognize his son, for he also took off his cap and waved it,
          and tried by gestures to make him understand that he would
          have returned if it had been possible, but that the sea was so
          tempestuous that he could not use his oars or approach the shore.</p>

     <p>Suddenly a tremendous wave rose and the boat disappeared.
          They waited, hoping it would come again to the surface,
          but it was seen no more.</p>

     <p>"Poor man!" said the fishermen who were assembled on
          the shore; murmuring a prayer, they turned to go home.</p>

     <p>Just then they heard a desperate cry and, looking back,
          they saw a little boy who exclaimed, as he jumped from a rock
          into the sea:</p>

     <p>"I will save my papa!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, being made of wood, floated easily and he swam
          like a fish. At one moment they saw him disappear under the
          water, carried down by the fury of the waves, and next he
          reappeared struggling with a leg or an arm. At last they lost
          sight of him and he was seen no more.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO FINDS THE FAIRY AGAIN</h2>


     <p>Pinocchio, hoping to be in time to help his father, swam
          the whole night.</p>

     <p>And what a horrible night it was! The rain came down
          in torrents, it hailed, the thunder was frightful, and the flashes
          of lightning made it as light as day.</p>

     <p>Towards morning he saw a long strip of land not far off.
          It was an island in the midst of the sea.</p>

     <p>He tried his utmost to reach the shore, but it was all in
          vain. The waves, racing and tumbling over each other, knocked
          him about as if he had been a stick or a wisp of straw. At
          last, fortunately for him, a billow rolled up with such fury
          and impetuosity that he was lifted up and thrown far on to
          the sands.</p>

     <p>He fell with such force that, as he struck the ground, his
          ribs and all his joints cracked, but he comforted himself, saying:</p>

     <p>"This time also I have made a wonderful escape!"</p>

     <p>Little by little the sky cleared, the sun shone out in all
          his splendor, and the sea became as quiet and as smooth as oil.</p>

     <p>The puppet put his clothes in the sun to dry and began
          to look in every direction in hopes of seeing on the vast expanse
          of water a little boat with a little man in it. But, although
          he looked and looked, he could see nothing but the sky, and
          the sea, and the sail of some ship, but so far away that it seemed
          no bigger than a fly.</p>

     <p>"If I only knew what this island was called!" he said to
          himself. "If I only knew whether it was inhabited by civilized
          people&mdash;I mean, by people who have not the bad habit
          of hanging boys to the branches of the trees. But whom can
          I ask? Whom, if there is nobody?"</p>

     <p>This idea of finding himself alone, alone, all alone, in the
          midst of this great uninhabited country, made him so melancholy
          that he was just beginning to cry. But at that moment,
          at a short distance from the shore, he saw a big fish swimming
          by; it was going quietly on its own business with its head out
          of the water.</p>

     <p>Not knowing its name, the puppet called to it in a loud
          voice to make himself heard:</p>

     <p>"Eh, Sir Fish, will you permit me a word with you?"</p>

     <p>"Two if you like," answered the fish, who was a Dolphin,
          and so polite that few similar are to be found in any sea in
          the world.</p>

     <p>"Will you be kind enough to tell me if there are villages
          in this island where it would be possible to obtain something
          to eat, without running the danger of being eaten?"</p>

     <p>"Certainly there are," replied the Dolphin. "Indeed, you
          will find one at a short distance from here."</p>

     <p>"And what road must I take to go there?"</p>

     <p>"You must take that path to your left and follow your
          nose. You cannot make a mistake."</p>

     <p>"Will you tell me another thing? You who swim about
          the sea all day and all night, have you by chance met a little
          boat with my papa in it?"</p>

     <p>"And who is your papa?"</p>

     <p>"He is the best papa in the world, whilst it would be
          difficult to find a worse son than I am."</p>

     <p>"During the terrible storm last night," answered the Dolphin,
          "the little boat must have gone to the bottom."</p>

     <p>"And my papa?"</p>

     <p>"He must have been swallowed by the terrible Dog-Fish,
          who for some days past has been spreading devastation and
          ruin in our waters."</p>

     <p>"Is this Dog-Fish very big?" asked Pinocchio, who was
          already beginning to quake with fear.</p>

     <p>"Big!" replied the Dolphin. "That you may form some
          idea of his size, I need only tell you that he is bigger than a
          five-storied house, and that his mouth is so enormous and so
          deep that a railway train with its smoking engine could pass
          down his throat."</p>

     <p>"Mercy upon us!" exclaimed the terrified puppet; and,
          putting on his clothes with the greatest haste, he said to the
          Dolphin:</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, Sir Fish; excuse the trouble I have given you,
          and many thanks for your politeness."</p>

     <p>He then took the path that had been pointed out to him
          and began to walk fast&mdash;so fast, indeed, that he was almost
          running. And at the slightest noise he turned to look behind
          him, fearing that he might see the terrible Dog-Fish with a
          railway train in its mouth following him.</p>

     <p>After a walk of half an hour he reached a little village
          called "The Village of the Industrious Bees." The road was
          alive with people running here and there to attend to their
          business; all were at work, all had something to do. You
          could not have found an idler or a vagabond, not even if you
          had searched for him with a lighted lamp.</p>

     <p>"Ah!" said that lazy Pinocchio at once, "I see that this
          village will never suit me! I wasn't born to work!"</p>

     <p>In the meanwhile he was tormented by hunger, for he had
          eaten nothing for twenty-four hours&mdash;not even vetch. What
          was he to do?</p>

     <p>There were only two ways by which he could obtain food&mdash;either
          by asking for a little work, or by begging for a nickel
          or for a mouthful of bread.</p>

     <p>He was ashamed to beg, for his father had always preached
          to him that no one had a right to beg except the aged and
          the infirm. The really poor in this world, deserving of compassion
          and assistance, are only those who from age or sickness
          are no longer able to earn their own bread with the labor of
          their hands. It is the duty of every one else to work; and if
          they will not work, so much the worse for them if they suffer
          from hunger.</p>

     <p>At that moment a man came down the road, tired and
          panting for breath. He was dragging, alone, with fatigue and
          difficulty, two carts full of charcoal.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, judging by his face that he was a kind man,
          approached him and, casting down his eyes with shame, he
          said to him in a low voice:</p>

     <p>"Would you have the charity to give me a nickel, for I
          am dying of hunger?"</p>

     <p>"You shall have not only a nickel," said the man, "but I
          will give you a quarter, provided that you help me to drag
          home these two carts of charcoal."</p>

     <p>"I am surprised at you!" answered the puppet in a tone
          of offense. "Let me tell you that I am not accustomed to do
          the work of a donkey: I have never drawn a cart!"</p>

     <p>"So much the better for you," answered the man. "Then,
          my boy, if you are really dying of hunger, eat two fine slices
          of your pride, and be careful not to get indigestion."</p>

     <p>A few minutes afterwards a mason passed down the road
          carrying on his shoulders a basket of lime.</p>

     <p>"Would you have the charity, good man, to give a nickel
          to a poor boy who is yawning for want of food?"</p>

     <p>"Willingly," answered the man. "Come with me and
          carry the lime, and instead of a nickel I will give you a
          quarter."</p>

     <p>"But the lime is heavy," objected Pinocchio, "and I don't
          want to tire myself."</p>

     <p>"If you don't want to tire yourself, then, my boy, amuse
          yourself with yawning, and much good may it do you."</p>

     <p>In less than half an hour twenty other people went by,
          and Pinocchio asked charity of them all, but they all answered:</p>

     <p>"Are you not ashamed to beg? Instead of idling about
          the roads, go and look for a little work and learn to earn
          your bread."</p>

     <p>At last a nice little woman carrying two cans of water
          came by.</p>

     <p>"Will you let me drink a little water out of your can?"
          asked Pinocchio, who was burning with thirst.</p>

     <p>"Drink, my boy, if you wish it!" said the little woman,
          setting down the two cans.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio drank like a fish, and as he dried his mouth
          he mumbled:</p>

     <p>"I have quenched my thirst. If I could only appease
          my hunger!"</p>

     <p>The good woman, hearing these words, said at once:</p>

     <p>"If you will help me to carry home these two cans of water
          I will give you a fine piece of bread."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio looked at the can and answered neither yes
          nor no.</p>

     <p>"And besides the bread you shall have a nice dish of cauliflower
          dressed with oil and vinegar," added the good woman.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio gave another look at the can and answered
          neither yes nor no.</p>

     <p>"And after the cauliflower I will give you a beautiful
          bonbon full of syrup."</p>

     <p>The temptation of this last dainty was so great that Pinocchio
          could resist no longer and with an air of decision he said:</p>

     <p>"I must have patience! I will carry the can to your house."</p>

     <p>The can was heavy and the puppet, not being strong
          enough to carry it in his hand, had to resign himself to carry
          it on his head.</p>

     <p>When they reached the house the good little woman made
          Pinocchio sit down at a small table already laid and she placed
          before him the bread, the cauliflower and the bonbon.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio did not eat, he devoured. His stomach was like
          an apartment that had been left empty and uninhabited for
          five months.</p>

     <p>When his ravenous hunger was somewhat appeased he
          raised his head to thank his benefactress, but he had no sooner
          looked at her than he gave a prolonged "Oh-h!" of astonishment
          and continued staring at her with wide open eyes, his
          fork in the air, and his mouth full of bread and cauliflower,
          as if he had been bewitched.</p>

     <p>"What has surprised you so much?" asked the good woman,
          laughing.</p>

     <p>"It is&mdash;" answered the puppet, "it is&mdash;it is&mdash;that you
          are like&mdash;that you remind me&mdash;yes, yes, yes, the same voice&mdash;the
          same eyes&mdash;the same hair&mdash;yes, yes, yes&mdash;you also have blue
          hair&mdash;as she had&mdash;Oh, little Fairy! tell me that it is you, really
          you! Do not make me cry any more! If you knew&mdash;I have
          cried so much, I have suffered so much."</p>

     <p>And, throwing himself at her feet on the floor, Pinocchio
          embraced the knees of the mysterious little woman and began
          to cry bitterly.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO PROMISES THE FAIRY TO BE GOOD</h2>


     <p>At first the good little woman maintained that she was not
          the little Fairy with blue hair, but, seeing that she was
          found out and not wishing to continue the comedy any longer,
          she ended by making herself known, and she said to Pinocchio:</p>

     <p>"You little rogue! how did you ever discover who I was?"</p>

     <p>"It was my great affection for you that told me."</p>

     <p>"Do you remember? You left me a child, and now that
          you have found me again I am a woman&mdash;a woman almost old
          enough to be your mamma."</p>

     <p>"I am delighted at that, for now, instead of calling you
          little sister, I will call you mamma. I have wished for such a
          long time to have a mamma like other boys! But how did you
          manage to grow so fast?"</p>

     <p>"That is a secret."</p>

     <p>"Teach it to me, for I should also like to grow. Don't
          you see? I always remain no bigger than a ninepin."</p>

     <p>"But you cannot grow," replied the Fairy.</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because puppets never grow. They are born puppets,
          live puppets, and die puppets."</p>

     <p>"Oh, I am sick of being a puppet!" cried Pinocchio, giving
          himself a slap. "It is time that I became a man."</p>

     <p>"And you will become one, if you know how to deserve it."</p>

     <p>"Not really? And what can I do to deserve it?"</p>

     <p>"A very easy thing: by learning to be a good boy."</p>

     <p>"And you think I am not?"</p>

     <p>"You are quite the contrary. Good boys are obedient,
          and you&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"And I never obey."</p>

     <p>"Good boys like to learn and to work, and you&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"And I instead lead an idle, vagabond life the year
          through."</p>

     <p>"Good boys always speak the truth."</p>

     <p>"And I always tell lies."</p>

     <p>"Good boys go willingly to school."</p>

     <p>"And school gives me pain all over the body. But from
          today I will change my life."</p>

     <p>"Do you promise me?"</p>

     <p>"I promise you. I will become a good little boy, and I
          will be the consolation of my papa. Where is my poor papa
          at this moment?"</p>

     <p>"I do not know."</p>

     <p>"Shall I ever have the happiness of seeing him again and
          kissing him?"</p>

     <p>"I think so; indeed, I am sure of it."</p>

     <p>At this answer Pinocchio was so delighted that he took
          the Fairy's hands and began to kiss them with such fervor
          that he seemed beside himself. Then, raising his face and looking
          at her lovingly, he asked:</p>

     <p>"Tell me, little mamma: then it was not true that you
          were dead?"</p>

     <p>"It seems not," said the Fairy, smiling.</p>

     <p>"If you only knew the sorrow I felt and the tightening
          of my throat when I read, 'Here lies&mdash;'"</p>

     <p>"I know it, and it is on that account that I have forgiven
          you. I saw from the sincerity of your grief that you had a
          good heart; and when boys have good hearts, even if they are
          scamps and have got bad habits, there is always something
          to hope for; that is, there is always hope that they will turn
          to better ways. That is why I came to look for you here. I
          will be your mamma."</p>

     <p>"Oh, how delightful!" shouted Pinocchio, jumping for joy.</p>

     <p>"You must obey me and do everything that I bid you."</p>

     <p>"Willingly, willingly, willingly!"</p>

     <p>"Tomorrow," rejoined the Fairy, "you will begin to go
          to school."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio became at once a little less joyful.</p>

     <p>"Then you must choose an art, or a trade, according to
          your own wishes."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio became very grave.</p>

     <p>"What are you muttering between your teeth?" asked the
          Fairy in an angry voice.</p>

     <p>"I was saying," moaned the puppet in a low voice, "that
          it seemed to me too late for me to go to school now."</p>

     <p>"No, sir. Keep it in mind that it is never too late to
          learn and to instruct ourselves."</p>

     <p>"But I do not wish to follow either an art or a trade."</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because it tires me to work."</p>

     <p>"My boy," said the Fairy, "those who talk in that way
          end almost always either in prison or in the hospital. Let me
          tell you that every man, whether he is born rich or poor, is
          obliged to do something in this world&mdash;to occupy himself, to
          work. Woe to those who lead slothful lives. Sloth is a dreadful
          illness and must be cured at once, in childhood. If not,
          when we are old it can never be cured."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio was touched by these words and, lifting his head
          quickly, he said to the Fairy:</p>

     <p>"I will study, I will work, I will do all that you tell me,
          for indeed I have become weary of being a puppet, and I wish
          at any price to become a boy. You promised me that I should,
          did you not?"</p>

     <p>"I did promise you, and it now depends upon yourself."</p>

     <h2>THE TERRIBLE DOG-FISH</h2>


     <p>The following day Pinocchio went to the government school.
          Imagine the delight of all the little rogues, when they
          saw a puppet walk into their school! They set up a roar of
          laughter that never ended. They played him all sorts of tricks.
          One boy carried off his cap, another pulled his jacket behind;
          one tried to give him a pair of inky mustachios just under his
          nose, and another attempted to tie strings to his feet and hands
          to make him dance.</p>

     <p>For a short time Pinocchio pretended not to care and got
          on as well as he could; but at last, losing all patience, he turned
          to those who were teasing him most and making game of him,
          and said to them, looking very angry:</p>

     <p>"Beware, boys! I have not come here to be your buffoon.
          I respect others, and I intend to be respected."</p>

     <p>"Well said, boaster! You have spoken like a book!"
          howled the young rascals, convulsed with mad laughter, and
          one of them, more impertinent than the others, stretched out
          his hand, intending to seize the puppet by the end of his nose.</p>

     <p>But he was not in time, for Pinocchio stuck his leg out
          from under the table and gave him a great kick on his shins.</p>

     <p>"Oh, what hard feet!" roared the boy, rubbing the bruise
          that the puppet had given him.</p>

     <p>"And what elbows! even harder than his feet!" said another,
          who for his rude tricks had received a blow in the stomach.</p>

     <p>But, nevertheless, the kick and the blow acquired at once
          for Pinocchio the sympathy and the esteem of all the boys in
          the school. They all made friends with him and liked him
          heartily.</p>

     <p>And even the master praised him, for he found him attentive,
          studious and intelligent&mdash;always the first to come to school,
          and the last to leave when school was over.</p>

     <p>But he had one fault: he made too many friends, and
          amongst them were several young rascals well known for their
          dislike to study and love of mischief.</p>

     <p>The master warned him every day, and even the good
          Fairy never failed to tell him and to repeat constantly:</p>

     <p>"Take care, Pinocchio! Those bad school-fellows of yours
          will end sooner or later by making you lose all love of study,
          and perhaps they may even bring upon you some great misfortune."</p>

     <p>"There is no fear of that!" answered the puppet, shrugging
          his shoulders and touching his forehead as much as to say:
          "There is so much sense here!"</p>

     <p>Now it happened that one fine day, as he was on his way
          to school, he met several of his usual companions who, coming
          up to him, asked:</p>

     <p>"Have you heard the great news?"</p>

     <p>"No."</p>

     <p>"In the sea near here a Dog-Fish has appeared as big
          as a mountain."</p>

     <p>"Not really? Can it be the same Dog-Fish that was there
          when my papa was drowned?"</p>

     <p>"We are going to the shore to see him. Will you come
          with us?"</p>

     <p>"No; I am going to school."</p>

     <p>"What matters school? We can go to school tomorrow.
          Whether we have a lesson more or a lesson less, we shall always
          remain the same donkeys."</p>

     <p>"But what will the master say?"</p>

     <p>"The master may say what he likes. He is paid on purpose
          to grumble all day."</p>

     <p>"And my mamma?"</p>

     <p>"Mammas know nothing," answered those bad little boys.</p>

     <p>"Do you know what I will do?" said Pinocchio. "I have
          reasons for wishing to see the Dog-Fish, but I will go and
          see him when school is over."</p>

     <p>"Poor donkey!" exclaimed one of the number. "Do you
          suppose that a fish of that size will wait your convenience?
          As soon as he is tired of being here he will start for another
          place, and then it will be too late."</p>

     <p>"How long does it take to go from here to the shore?"
          asked the puppet.</p>

     <p>"We can be there and back in an hour."</p>

     <p>"Then away!" shouted Pinocchio, "and he who runs fastest
          is the best!"</p>

     <p>Having thus given the signal to start, the boys, with their
          books and copy-books under their arms, rushed off across the
          fields, and Pinocchio was always the first&mdash;he seemed to have
          wings to his feet.</p>

     <p>From time to time he turned to jeer at his companions,
          who were some distance behind, and, seeing them panting for
          breath, covered with dust, and their tongues hanging out of
          their mouths, he laughed heartily. The unfortunate boy little
          knew what terrors and horrible disasters he was going to
          meet with!</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO IS ARRESTED BY THE GENDARMES</h2>


     <p>When he arrived on the shore Pinocchio looked out to
          sea, but he saw no Dog-Fish. The sea was as smooth
          as a great crystal mirror.</p>

     <p>"Where is the Dog-Fish?" he asked, turning to his companions.</p>

     <p>"He must have gone to have his breakfast," said one of
          them, laughing.</p>

     <p>"Or he has thrown himself on to his bed to have a little
          nap," added another, laughing still louder.</p>

     <p>From their absurd answers and silly laughter Pinocchio
          perceived that his companions had been making a fool of him,
          in inducing him to believe a tale with no truth in it. Taking
          it very badly, he said to them angrily:</p>

     <p>"And now, may I ask what fun you could find in deceiving
          me with the story of the Dog-Fish?"</p>

     <p>"Oh, it was great fun!" answered the little rascals in chorus.</p>

     <p>"And in what did it consist?"</p>

     <p>"In making you miss school and persuading you to come
          with us. Are you not ashamed of being always so punctual
          and so diligent with your lessons? Are you not ashamed of
          studying so hard?"</p>

     <p>"And if I study hard, what concern is it of yours?"</p>

     <p>"It concerns us excessively, because it makes us appear in
          a bad light to the master."</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because boys who study make those who, like us, have
          no wish to learn, seem worse by comparison. And that is too
          bad. We, too, have our pride!"</p>

     <p>"Then what must I do to please you?"</p>

     <p>"You must follow our example and hate school, lessons,
          and the master&mdash;our three greatest enemies."</p>

     <p>"And if I wish to continue my studies?"</p>

     <p>"In that case we will have nothing more to do with you,
          and at the first opportunity we will make you pay for it."</p>

     <p>"Really," said the puppet, shaking his head, "you make
          me inclined to laugh."</p>

     <p>"Eh, Pinocchio" shouted the biggest of the boys, confronting
          him. "None of your superior airs: don't come here
          to crow over us, for if you are not afraid of us, we are not
          afraid of you. Remember that you are one against seven of us."</p>

     <p>"Seven, like the seven deadly sins," said Pinocchio, with
          a shout of laughter.</p>

     <p>"Listen to him! He has insulted us all! He called us
          the seven deadly sins!"</p>

     <p>"Take that to begin with and keep it for your supper
          tonight," said one of the boys.</p>

     <p>And, so saying, he gave him a blow on the head with his fist.</p>

     <p>But it was give and take; for the puppet, as was to be
          expected, immediately returned the blow, and the fight in a
          moment became general and desperate.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, although he was one alone, defended himself
          like a hero. He used his feet, which were of the hardest wood,
          to such purpose that he kept his enemies at a respectful distance.
          Wherever they touched they left a bruise by way of
          reminder.</p>

     <p>The boys, becoming furious at not being able to measure
          themselves hand to hand with the puppet, had recourse to other
          weapons. Loosening their satchels, they commenced throwing
          their school-books at him&mdash;grammars, dictionaries, spelling-books,
          geography books, and other scholastic works. But
          Pinocchio was quick and had sharp eyes, and always managed
          to duck in time, so that the books passed over his head and
          all fell into the sea.</p>

     <p>Imagine the astonishment of the fish! Thinking that the
          books were something to eat they all arrived in shoals, but,
          having tasted a page or two, or a frontispiece, they spat it
          quickly out and made a wry face that seemed to say: "It
          isn't food for us; we are accustomed to something much better!"</p>

     <p>The battle meantime had become fiercer than ever, when a
          big crab, who had come out of the water and had climbed
          slowly up on the shore, called out in a hoarse voice that sounded
          like a trumpet with a bad cold:</p>

     <p>"Have done with that, you young ruffians, for you are
          nothing else! These hand-to-hand fights between boys seldom
          finish well. Some disaster is sure to happen!"</p>

     </div>



     <p>Poor crab! He might as well have preached to the wind.
          Even that young rascal, Pinocchio, turning around, looked at
          him mockingly and said rudely:</p>

     <p>"Hold your tongue, you tiresome crab! You had better
          suck some liquorice lozenges to cure that cold in your throat."</p>

     <p>Just then the boys, who had no more books of their own
          to throw, spied at a little distance the satchel that belonged to
          Pinocchio, and took possession of it.</p>

     <p>Amongst the books there was one bound in strong cardboard
          with the back and points of parchment. It was a Treatise
          on Arithmetic.</p>

     <p>One of the boys seized this volume and, aiming at Pinocchio's
          head, threw it at him with all the force he could muster.
          But instead of hitting the puppet it struck one of his
          companions on the temple, who, turning as white as a sheet,
          said only:</p>

     <p>"Oh, mother! help, I am dying!" and fell his whole length
          on the sand. Thinking he was dead, the terrified boys ran off
          as hard as their legs could carry them and in a few minutes
          they were out of sight.</p>

     <p>But Pinocchio remained. Although from grief and fright
          he was more dead than alive, nevertheless he ran and soaked
          his handkerchief in the sea and began to bathe the temples of
          his poor school-fellow. Crying bitterly in his despair, he kept
          calling him by name and saying to him:</p>

     <p>"Eugene! my poor Eugene! Open your eyes and look at
          me! Why do you not answer? I did not do it; indeed it was
          not I that hurt you so! believe me, it was not! Open your eyes,
          Eugene. If you keep your eyes shut I shall die, too. Oh!
          what shall I do? how shall I ever return home? How can I
          ever have the courage to go back to my good mamma? What
          will become of me? Where can I fly to? Oh! how much better
          it would have been, a thousand times better, if I had only
          gone to school! Why did I listen to my companions? they
          have been my ruin. The master said to me, and my mamma
          repeated it often: 'Beware of bad companions!' Oh, dear!
          what will become of me, what will become of me, what will
          become of me?"</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio began to cry and sob, and to strike his head
          with his fists, and to call poor Eugene by his name. Suddenly
          he heard the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>

     <p>He turned and saw two soldiers.</p>

     <p>"What are you doing there, lying on the ground?" they
          asked Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"I am helping my school-fellow."</p>

     <p>"Has he been hurt?"</p>

     <p>"So it seems."</p>

     <p>"Hurt indeed!" said one of them, stooping down and
          examining Eugene closely.</p>

     <p>"This boy has been wounded in the temple. Who wounded
          him?"</p>

     <p>"Not I," stammered the puppet breathlessly.</p>

     <p>"If it was not you, who then did it?"</p>

     <p>"Not I," repeated Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"And with what was he wounded?"</p>

     <p>"With this book." And the puppet picked up from the
          ground the Treatise on Arithmetic, bound in cardboard and
          parchment, and showed it to the soldier.</p>

     <p>"And to whom does this belong?"</p>

     <p>"To me."</p>

     <p>"That is enough, nothing more is wanted. Get up and
          come with us at once."</p>

     <p>"But I&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"Come along with us!"</p>

     <p>"But I am innocent."</p>

     <p>"Come along with us!"</p>

     <p>Before they left, the soldiers called some fishermen who
          were passing at that moment near the shore in their boat, and
          said to them:</p>

     <p>"We give this boy who has been wounded in the head in
          your charge. Carry him to your house and nurse him. Tomorrow
          we will come and see him."</p>

     <p>They then turned to Pinocchio and, having placed him
          between them, they said to him in a commanding voice:</p>

     <p>"Forward! and walk quickly, or it will be the worse
          for you."</p>

     <p>Without requiring it to be repeated, the puppet set out
          along the road leading to the village. But the poor little devil
          hardly knew where he was. He thought he must be dreaming,
          and what a dreadful dream! He was beside himself. He saw
          double; his legs shook; his tongue clung to the roof of his
          mouth, and he could not utter a word. And yet, in the midst
          of his stupefaction and apathy, his heart was pierced by a cruel
          thorn&mdash;the thought that he would pass under the windows of
          the good Fairy's house between the soldiers. He would rather
          have died.</p>

     <p>They had already reached the village when a gust of wind
          blew Pinocchio's cap off his head and carried it ten yards off.</p>

     <p>"Will you permit me," said the puppet to the soldiers,
          "to go and get my cap?"</p>

     <p>"Go, then; but be quick about it."</p>

     <p>The puppet went and picked up his cap, but instead of
          putting it on his head he took it between his teeth and began
          to run as hard as he could towards the seashore.</p>

     <p>The soldiers, thinking it would be difficult to overtake him,
          sent after him a large mastiff who had won the first prizes at
          all the dog races. Pinocchio ran, but the dog ran faster. The
          people came to their windows and crowded into the street in
          their anxiety to see the end of the desperate race.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO ESCAPES BEING FRIED LIKE A FISH</h2>


     <p>There came a moment in this desperate race&mdash;a terrible
          moment&mdash;when Pinocchio thought himself lost: for Alidoro,
          the mastiff, had run so swiftly that he had nearly come up
          with him.</p>

     <p>The puppet could hear the panting of the dreadful beast
          close behind him; there was not a hand's breadth between them,
          he could even feel the dog's hot breath.</p>

     <p>Fortunately the shore was close and the sea but a few
          steps off.</p>

     <p>As soon as he reached the sands the puppet made a wonderful
          leap&mdash;a frog could have done no better&mdash;and plunged
          into the water.</p>

     <p>Alidoro, on the contrary, wished to stop himself, but, carried
          away by the impetus of the race, he also went into the
          sea. The unfortunate dog could not swim, but he made great
          efforts to keep himself afloat with his paws; but the more he
          struggled the farther he sank head downwards under the water.</p>

     <p>When he rose to the surface again his eyes were rolling
          with terror, and he barked out:</p>

     <p>"I am drowning! I am drowning!"</p>

     <p>"Drown!" shouted Pinocchio from a distance, seeing himself
          safe from all danger.</p>

     <p>"Help me, dear Pinocchio! Save me from death!"</p>

     <p>At that agonizing cry the puppet, who had in reality an
          excellent heart, was moved with compassion, and, turning to
          the dog, he said:</p>

     <p>"But if I save your life, will you promise to give me no
          further annoyance, and not to run after me?"</p>

     <p>"I promise! I promise! Be quick, for pity's sake, for if
          you delay another half-minute I shall be dead."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio hesitated; but, remembering that his father had
          often told him that a good action is never lost, he swam to
          Alidoro, and, taking hold of his tail with both hands, brought
          him safe and sound on to the dry sand of the beach.</p>

     <p>The poor dog could not stand. He had drunk so much
          salt water that he was like a balloon. The puppet, however,
          not wishing to trust him too far, thought it more prudent to
          jump again into the water. When he had swum some distance
          from the shore he called out to the friend he had rescued:</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, Alidoro; a good journey to you, and take
          my compliments to all at home."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, Pinocchio," answered the dog; "a thousand
          thanks for having saved my life. You have done me a great
          service, and in this world what is given is returned. If an
          occasion offers I shall not forget it."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio swam on, keeping always near the land. At last
          he thought that he had reached a safe place. Giving a look
          along the shore, he saw amongst the rocks a kind of cave from
          which a cloud of smoke was ascending.</p>

     <p>"In that cave," he said to himself, "there must be a fire.
          So much the better. I will go and dry and warm myself, and
          then? and then we shall see."</p>

     <p>Having taken the resolution he approached the rocks,
          but, as he was going to climb up, he felt something under the
          water that rose higher and higher and carried him into the air.
          He tried to escape, but it was too late, for, to his extreme surprise,
          he found himself enclosed in a great net, together with
          a swarm of fish of every size and shape, who were flapping
          and struggling like so many despairing souls.</p>

     <p>At the same moment a fisherman came out of the cave;
          he was so ugly, so horribly ugly, that he looked like a sea
          monster. Instead of hair his head was covered with a thick
          bush of green grass, his skin was green, his eyes were green,
          his long beard that came down to the ground was also green.
          He had the appearance of an immense lizard standing on its
          hind-paws.</p>

     <p>When the fisherman had drawn his net out of the sea,
          he exclaimed with great satisfaction:</p>

     <p>"Thank Heaven! Again today I shall have a splendid
          feast of fish!"</p>

     <p>"What a mercy that I am not a fish!" said Pinocchio to
          himself, regaining a little courage.</p>

     <p>The netful of fish was carried into the cave, which was
          dark and smoky. In the middle of the cave a large frying-pan
          full of oil was frying and sending out a smell of mushrooms
          that was suffocating.</p>

     <p>"Now we will see what fish we have taken!" said the
          green fisherman, and, putting into the net an enormous hand,
          so out of all proportion that it looked like a baker's shovel,
          he pulled out a handful of fish.</p>

     <p>"These fish are good!" he said, looking at them and smelling
          them complacently. And after he had smelled them he
          threw them into a pan without water.</p>

     <p>He repeated the same operation many times, and as he
          drew out the fish his mouth watered and he said, chuckling
          to himself:</p>

     <p>"What good whiting!"</p>

     <p>"What exquisite sardines!"</p>

     <p>"These soles are delicious!"</p>

     <p>"And these crabs excellent!"</p>

     <p>"What dear little anchovies!"</p>

     <p>The last to remain in the net was Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>No sooner had the fisherman taken him out than he opened
          his big green eyes with astonishment and cried, half frightened:</p>

     <p>"What species of fish is this? Fish of this kind I never
          remember to have eaten."</p>

     <p>And he looked at him again attentively and, having examined
          him well all over, he ended by saying:</p>

     <p>"I know: he must be a craw-fish."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, mortified at being mistaken for a craw-fish, said
          in an angry voice:</p>

     <p>"A craw-fish indeed! Do you take me for a craw-fish?
          what treatment! Let me tell you that I am a puppet."</p>

     <p>"A puppet?" replied the fisherman. "To tell the truth, a
          puppet is quite a new fish for me. All the better! I shall
          eat you with greater pleasure."</p>

     <p>"Eat me! but will you understand that I am not a fish?
          Do you hear that I talk and reason as you do?"</p>

     <p>"That is quite true," said the fisherman; "and as I see
          that you are a fish possessed of the talent of talking and
          reasoning as I do, I will treat you with all the attention that
          is your due."</p>

     <p>"And this attention?"</p>

     <p>"In token of my friendship and particular regard, I will
          leave you the choice of how you would like to be cooked.
          Would you like to be fried in the frying-pan, or would you
          prefer to be stewed with tomato sauce?"</p>

     <p>"To tell the truth," answered Pinocchio, "if I am to choose,
          I should prefer to be set at liberty and to return home."</p>

     <p>"You are joking! Do you imagine that I would lose the
          opportunity of tasting such a rare fish? It is not every day,
          I assure you, that a puppet fish is caught in these waters.
          Leave it to me. I will fry you in the frying-pan with the
          other fish, and you will be quite satisfied. It is always consolation
          to be fried in company."</p>

     <p>At this speech the unhappy Pinocchio began to cry and
          scream and to implore for mercy, and he said, sobbing: "How
          much better it would have been if I had gone to school! I
          would listen to my companions and now I am paying for it."</p>

     <p>And he wriggled like an eel and made indescribable efforts
          to slip out of the clutches of the green fisherman. But it was
          useless: the fisherman took a long strip of rush and, having
          bound his hands and feet as if he had been a sausage, he
          threw him into the pan with the other fish.</p>

     <p>He then fetched a wooden bowl full of flour and began
          to flour them each in turn, and as soon as they were ready he
          threw them into the frying-pan.</p>

     <p>The first to dance in the boiling oil were the poor whitings;
          the crabs followed, then the sardines, then the soles, then the
          anchovies, and at last it was Pinocchio's turn. Seeing himself
          so near death, and such a horrible death, he was so frightened,
          and trembled so violently, that he had neither voice nor breath
          left for further entreaties.</p>

     <p>But the poor boy implored with his eyes! The green fisherman,
          however, without caring in the least, plunged him five
          or six times in the flour, until he was white from head to foot
          and looked like a puppet made of plaster.</p>

     <h2>HE RETURNS TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE</h2>


     <p>Just as the fisherman was on the point of throwing Pinocchio
          into the frying-pan a large dog entered the cave, enticed
          there by the strong and savory odor of fried fish.</p>

     <p>"Get out!" shouted the fisherman, threateningly, holding
          the floured puppet in his hand.</p>

     <p>But the poor dog, who was as hungry as a wolf, whined
          and wagged his tail as much as to say:</p>

     <p>"Give me a mouthful of fish and I will leave you in peace."</p>

     <p>"Get out, I tell you!" repeated the fisherman and he
          stretched out his leg to give him a kick.</p>

     <p>But the dog, who, when he was really hungry, would not
          stand trifling, turned upon him, growling and showing his terrible
          tusks.</p>

     <p>At that moment a little feeble voice was heard in the cave,
          saying entreatingly:</p>

     <p>"Save me, Alidoro! If you do not save me I shall be
          fried!"</p>

     <p>The dog recognized Pinocchio's voice and, to his extreme
          surprise, perceived that it proceeded from the floured bundle
          that the fisherman held in his hand.</p>

     <p>So what do you think he did? He made a spring, seized
          the bundle in his mouth, and, holding it gently between his
          teeth, he rushed out of the cave and was gone like a flash of
          lightning.</p>

     <p>The fisherman, furious at seeing a fish he was so anxious
          to eat snatched from him, ran after the dog, but he had not gone
          many steps when he was taken with a fit of coughing and had
          to give it up.</p>

     <p>Alidoro, when he had reached the path that led to the village,
          stopped and put his friend Pinocchio gently on the ground.</p>

     <p>"How much I have to thank you for!" said the puppet.</p>

     <p>"There is no necessity," replied the dog. "You saved me
          and I have now returned it. You know that we must all help
          each other in this world."</p>

     <p>"But how came you to come to the cave?"</p>

     <p>"I was lying on the shore more dead than alive when the
          wind brought to me the smell of fried fish. The smell excited
          my appetite and I followed it up. If I had arrived a second
          later&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"Do not mention it!" groaned Pinocchio, who was still trembling
          with fright. "Do not mention it! If you had arrived
          a second later I should by this time have been fried, eaten and
          digested. Brrr! It makes me shudder only to think of it!"</p>

     <p>Alidoro, laughing, extended his right paw to the puppet,
          who shook it heartily in token of great friendship, and they
          then separated.</p>

     <p>The dog took the road home, and Pinocchio, left alone, went
          to a cottage not far off and said to a little old man who was
          warming himself in the sun:</p>

     <p>"Tell me, good man, do you know anything of a poor boy
          called Eugene who was wounded in the head?"</p>

     <p>"The boy was brought by some fishermen to this cottage,
          and now&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"And now he is dead!" interrupted Pinocchio with great
          sorrow.</p>

     <p>"No, he is alive and has returned to his home."</p>

     <p>"Not really? not really?" cried the puppet, dancing with
          delight. "Then the wound was not serious?"</p>

     <p>"It might have been very serious and even fatal," answered
          the little old man, "for they threw a thick book bound in cardboard
          at his head."</p>

     <p>"And who threw it at him?"</p>

     <p>"One of his school-fellows, a certain Pinocchio."</p>

     <p>"And who is this Pinocchio?" asked the puppet, pretending
          ignorance.</p>

     <p>"They say that he is a bad boy, a vagabond, a regular
          good-for-nothing."</p>

     <p>"Calumnies! all calumnies!"</p>

     <p>"Do you know this Pinocchio?"</p>

     <p>"By sight!" answered the puppet.</p>

     <p>"And what is your opinion of him?" asked the little man.</p>

     <p>"He seems to me to be a very good boy, anxious to learn,
          and obedient and affectionate to his father and family."</p>

     <p>Whilst the puppet was firing off all these lies, he touched
          his nose and perceived that it had lengthened more than a hand.
          Very much alarmed he began to cry out:</p>

     <p>"Don't believe, good man, what I have been telling you.
          I know Pinocchio very well and I can assure you that he is
          a very bad boy, disobedient and idle, who, instead of going to
          school, runs off with his companions to amuse himself."</p>

     <p>He had hardly finished speaking when his nose became
          shorter and returned to the same size that it was before.</p>

     <p>"And why are you all covered with white?" asked the old
          man suddenly.</p>

     <p>"I will tell you. Without observing it I rubbed myself
          against a wall which had been freshly whitewashed," answered
          the puppet, ashamed to confess that he had been floured like
          a fish prepared for the frying-pan.</p>

     <p>"And what have you done with your jacket, your trousers,
          and your cap?"</p>

     <p>"I met with robbers, who took them from me. Tell me,
          good old man, could you perhaps give me some clothes to return
          home in?"</p>

     <p>"My boy, as to clothes, I have nothing but a little sack in
          which I keep beans. If you wish for it, take it; there it is."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio did not wait to be told twice. He took the sack
          at once and with a pair of scissors he cut a hole at the end
          and at each side, and put it on like a shirt. And with this slight
          clothing he set off for the village.</p>

     <p>But as he went he did not feel at all comfortable&mdash;so little
          so, indeed, that for a step forward he took another backwards,
          and he said, talking to himself:</p>

     <p>"How shall I ever present myself to my good little Fairy?
          What will she say when she sees me? Will she forgive me this
          second escapade? Oh, I am sure that she will not forgive me!
          And it serves me right, for I am a rascal. I am always promising
          to correct myself and I never keep my word!"</p>

     <p>When he reached the village it was night and very dark.
          A storm had come on and as the rain was coming down in
          torrents he went straight to the Fairy's house, resolved to knock
          at the door.</p>

     <p>But when he was there his courage failed him and instead
          of knocking he ran away some twenty paces. He returned to
          the door a second time and laid hold of the knocker, and, trembling,
          gave a little knock.</p>

     <p>He waited and waited. At last, after half an hour had
          passed, a window on the top floor was opened&mdash;the house was
          four stories high&mdash;and Pinocchio saw a big Snail with a lighted
          candle on her head looking out. She called to him:</p>

     <p>"Who is there at this hour?"</p>

     <p>"Is the Fairy at home?" asked the puppet.</p>

     <p>"The Fairy is asleep and must not be awakened; but who
          are you?"</p>

     <p>"It is I."</p>

     <p>"Who is I?"</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio."</p>

     <p>"And who is Pinocchio?"</p>

     <p>"The puppet who lives in the Fairy's house."</p>

     <p>"Ah, I understand!" said the Snail. "Wait for me there.
          I will come down and open the door directly."</p>

     <p>"Be quick, for pity's sake, for I am dying of cold."</p>

     <p>"My boy, I am a snail, and snails are never in a hurry."</p>

     <p>An hour passed, and then two, and the door was not opened.
          Pinocchio, who was wet through and through, and trembling
          from cold and fear, at last took courage and knocked again,
          and this time he knocked louder.</p>

     <p>At this second knock a window on the lower story opened
          and the same Snail appeared at it.</p>

     <p>"Beautiful little Snail," cried Pinocchio from the street,
          "I have been waiting for two hours! And two hours on such
          a bad night seem longer than two years. Be quick, for pity's
          sake."</p>

     <p>"My boy," answered the calm little animal&mdash;"my boy, I
          am a snail, and snails are never in a hurry."</p>

     <p>And the window was shut again.</p>

     <p>Shortly afterwards midnight struck; then one o'clock, then
          two o'clock, and the door remained still closed.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio at last, losing all patience, seized the knocker
          in a rage, intending to give a blow that would resound through
          the house. But the knocker, which was iron, turned suddenly
          into an eel and, slipping out of his hands, disappeared in
          the stream of water that ran down the middle of the street.</p>

     <p>"Ah! is that it?" shouted Pinocchio, blind with rage.
          "Since the knocker has disappeared, I will kick instead with
          all my might."</p>

     <p>And, drawing a little back, he gave a tremendous kick
          against the house door. The blow was indeed so violent that
          his foot went through the wood and stuck; and when he tried
          to draw it back again it was trouble thrown away, for it
          remained fixed like a nail that has been hammered down.</p>

     <p>Think of poor Pinocchio! He was obliged to spend the
          remainder of the night with one foot on the ground and the
          other in the air.</p>

     <p>The following morning at daybreak the door was at last
          opened. The clever little Snail had taken only nine hours
          to come down from the fourth story to the house-door. It
          is evident that her exertions must have been great.</p>

     <p>"What are you doing with your foot stuck in the door?"
          she asked the puppet.</p>

     <p>"It was an accident. Do try, beautiful little Snail, if
          you cannot release me from this torture."</p>

     <p>"My boy, that is the work of a carpenter, and I have
          never been a carpenter."</p>

     <p>"Beg the Fairy from me!"</p>

     <p>"The Fairy is asleep and must not be awakened."</p>

     <p>"But what do you suppose that I can do all day nailed
          to this door?"</p>

     <p>"Amuse yourself by counting the ants that pass down
          the street."</p>

     <p>"Bring me at least something to eat, for I am quite
          exhausted."</p>

     <p>"At once," said the Snail.</p>

     <p>In fact, after three hours and a half she returned to
          Pinocchio carrying a silver tray on her head. The tray contained
          a loaf of bread, a roast chicken, and four ripe apricots.</p>

     <p>"Here is the breakfast that the Fairy has sent you," said
          the Snail.</p>

     <p>The puppet felt very much comforted at the sight of
          these good things. But when he began to eat them, what
          was his disgust at making the discovery that the bread was
          plaster, the chicken cardboard, and the four apricots painted
          alabaster.</p>

     <p>He wanted to cry. In his desperation he tried to throw
          away the tray and all that was on it; but instead, either from
          grief or exhaustion, he fainted away.</p>

     <p>When he came to himself he found that he was lying on
          a sofa, and the Fairy was beside him.</p>

     <p>"I will pardon you once more," the Fairy said, "but woe
          to you if you behave badly a third time!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio promised and swore that he would study, and
          that for the future he would always conduct himself well.</p>

     <p>And he kept his word for the remainder of the year.
          Indeed, at the examinations before the holidays, he had the
          honor of being the first in the school, and his behavior in
          general was so satisfactory and praiseworthy that the Fairy
          was very much pleased, and said to him:</p>

     <p>"Tomorrow your wish shall be gratified."</p>

     <p>"And that is?"</p>

     <p>"Tomorrow you shall cease to be a wooden puppet and
          you shall become a boy."</p>

     <p>No one who had not witnessed it could ever imagine
          Pinocchio's joy at this long-sighed-for good fortune. All his
          school-fellows were to be invited for the following day to a
          grand breakfast at the Fairy's house, that they might celebrate
          together the great event. The Fairy had prepared two
          hundred cups of coffee and milk, and four hundred rolls cut
          and buttered on each side. The day promised to be most
          happy and delightful, but&mdash;</p>

     <p>Unfortunately in the lives of puppets there is always a
          "but" that spoils everything.</p>

     <h2>THE "LAND OF BOOBIES"</h2>


     <p>Pinocchio, as was natural, asked the Fairy's permission
          to go round the town to give out the invitations, and the
          Fairy said to him:</p>

     <p>"Go, if you like, and invite your companions for the
          breakfast tomorrow, but remember to return home before dark.
          Have you understood?"</p>

     <p>"I promise to be back in an hour," answered the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Take care, Pinocchio! Boys are always very ready to
          promise, but generally they are little given to keep their word."</p>

     <p>"But I am not like other boys. When I say a thing,
          I do it."</p>

     <p>"We shall see. If you are disobedient, so much the worse
          for you."</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"Because boys who do not listen to the advice of those
          who know more than they do always meet with some misfortune or other."</p>

     <p>"I have experienced that," said Pinocchio, "but I shall
          never make that mistake again."</p>

     <p>"We shall see if that is true."</p>

     <p>Without saying more the puppet took leave of his good
          Fairy, who was like a mamma to him, and went out of the
          house singing and dancing.</p>

     <p>In less than an hour all his friends were invited. Some
          accepted at once heartily; others at first required pressing; but
          when they heard that the rolls to be eaten with the coffee were
          to be buttered on both sides they ended by saying:</p>

     <p>"We will come also, to do you a pleasure."</p>

     <p>Now I must tell you that amongst Pinocchio's friends
          and school-fellows there was one that he greatly preferred and
          was very fond of. This boy's name was Romeo, but he always
          went by the nickname of Candlewick, because he was so thin,
          straight and bright, like the new wick of a little nightlight.</p>

     <p>Candlewick was the laziest and the naughtiest boy in the
          school, but Pinocchio was devoted to him. He had indeed
          gone at once to his house to invite him to the breakfast, but
          he had not found him. He returned a second time, but Candlewick
          was not there. He went a third time, but it was in
          vain. Where could he search for him? He looked here, there,
          and everywhere, and at last he saw him hiding on the porch
          of a peasant's cottage.</p>

     <p>"What are you doing there?" asked Pinocchio, coming
          up to him.</p>

     <p>"I am waiting for midnight, to start away."</p>

     <p>"And where are you going?"</p>

     <p>"I am going to live in a country&mdash;the most delightful
          country in the world: a real land of sweetmeats!"</p>

     <p>"And what is it called?"</p>

     <p>"It is called the 'Land of Boobies.' Why do you not
          come, too?"</p>

     <p>"I? No, never!"</p>

     <p>"You are wrong, Pinocchio. If you do not come you
          will repent it. Where could you find a better country for us
          boys? There are no schools there; there are no masters; there
          are no books. In that delightful land nobody ever studies.
          On Saturday there is never school, and every week consists
          of six Saturdays and one Sunday. Only think, the autumn
          holidays begin on the first of January and finish on the last
          day of December. That is the country for me! That is what
          all civilized countries should be like!"</p>

     <p>"But how are the days spent in the 'Land of Boobies'?"</p>

     <p>They are spent in play and amusement from morning till
          night. When night comes you go to bed, and recommence
          the same life in the morning. What do you think of it?"</p>

     <p>"Hum!" said Pinocchio, and he shook his head slightly,
          as much as to say, "That is a life that I also would willingly
          lead."</p>

     <p>"Well, will you go with me? Yes or no? Resolve quickly."</p>

     <p>"No, no, no, and again no. I promised my good Fairy
          to become a well conducted boy, and I will keep my word.
          And as I see that the sun is setting I must leave you at once
          and run away. Good-bye, and a pleasant journey to you."</p>

     <p>"Where are you rushing off to in such a hurry?"</p>

     <p>"Home. My good Fairy wishes me to be back before
          dark."</p>

     <p>"Wait another two minutes."</p>

     <p>"It will make me too late."</p>

     <p>"Only two minutes."</p>

     <p>"And if the Fairy scolds me?"</p>

     <p>"Let her scold. When she has scolded well she will hold
          her tongue," said that rascal Candlewick.</p>

     <p>"And what are you going to do? Are you going alone
          or with companions?"</p>

     <p>"Alone? Indeed not, there will be more than a hundred
          boys."</p>

     <p>"And do you make the journey on foot?"</p>

     <p>"A coach will pass by shortly which is to take me to that
          happy country."</p>

     <p>"What would I not give for the coach to pass by now!"</p>

     <p>"Why?"</p>

     <p>"That I might see you all start together."</p>

     <p>"Stay here a little longer and you will see us."</p>

     <p>"No, no, I must go home."</p>

     <p>"Wait another two minutes."</p>

     <p>"I have already delayed too long. The Fairy will be
          anxious about me."</p>

     <p>"Poor Fairy! Is she afraid that the bats will eat you?"</p>

     <p>"But now," continued Pinocchio, "are you really certain
          that there are no schools in that country?"</p>

     <p>"Not even the shadow of one."</p>

     <p>"And no masters either?"</p>

     <p>"Not one."</p>

     <p>"And no one is ever made to study?"</p>

     <p>"Never, never, never!"</p>

     <p>"What a delightful country!" said Pinocchio, his mouth
          watering. "What a delightful country! I have never been
          there, but I can quite imagine it."</p>

     <p>"Why will you not come also?"</p>

     <p>"It is useless to tempt me. I promised my good Fairy
          to become a sensible boy, and I will not break my word."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, then, and give my compliments to all the
          boys at school, if you meet them in the street."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, Candlewick; a pleasant journey to you; amuse
          yourself, and think sometimes of your friends."</p>

     <p>Thus saying, the puppet made two steps to go, but then
          stopped, and, turning to his friend, he inquired:</p>

     <p>"But are you quite certain that in that country all the
          weeks consist of six Saturdays and one Sunday?"</p>

     <p>"Most certainly."</p>

     <p>"But do you know for certain that the holidays begin on
          the first of January and finish on the last day of December?"</p>

     <p>"Assuredly."</p>

     <p>"What a delightful country!" repeated Pinocchio, looking
          enchanted. Then, with a resolute air, he added in a great
          hurry:</p>

     <p>"This time really good-bye, and a pleasant journey to you."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye."</p>

     <p>"When do you start?"</p>

     <p>"Shortly."</p>

     <p>"What a pity! If really it wanted only an hour to the
          time of your start, I should almost be tempted to wait."</p>

     <p>"And the Fairy?"</p>

     <p>"It is already late. If I return home an hour sooner or
          later it will be all the same."</p>

     <p>"Poor Pinocchio! And if the Fairy scolds you?"</p>

     <p>"I must have patience! I will let her scold. When she
          has scolded well she will hold her tongue."</p>

     <p>In the meantime night had come on and it was quite dark.
          Suddenly they saw in the distance a small light moving and
          they heard a noise of talking, and the sound of a trumpet,
          but so small and feeble that it resembled the hum of a mosquito.</p>

     <p>"Here it is!" shouted Candlewick, jumping to his feet.</p>

     <p>"What is it?" asked Pinocchio in a whisper.</p>

     <p>"It is the coach coming to take me. Now will you come,
          yes or no?"</p>

     <p>"But is it really true," asked the puppet, "that in that
          country boys are never obliged to study?"</p>

     <p>"Never, never, never!"</p>

     <p>"What a delightful country! What a delightful country!
          What a delightful country!"</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO ENJOYS FIVE MONTHS OF HAPPINESS</h2>


     <p>At last the coach arrived, and it arrived without making
          the slightest noise, for its wheels were bound round with
          flax and rags.</p>

     <p>It was drawn by twelve pairs of donkeys, all the same
          size but of different colors.</p>

     <p>Some were gray, some white, some brindled like pepper
          and salt, and others had large stripes of yellow and blue.</p>

     <p>But the most extraordinary thing was this: the twelve
          pairs, that is, the twenty-four donkeys, instead of being shod
          like other beasts of burden, had on their feet men's boots
          made of white kid.</p>

     <p>And the coachman?</p>

     <p>Picture to yourself a little man broader than he was long,
          flabby and greasy like a lump of butter, with a small round
          face like an orange, a little mouth that was always laughing,
          and a soft, caressing voice like a cat when she is trying to
          insinuate herself into the good graces of the mistress of the
          house.</p>

     <p>All the boys vied with each other in taking places in his
          coach, to be conducted to the "Land of Boobies."</p>

     <p>The coach was, in fact, quite full of boys between eight
          and fourteen years old, heaped one upon another like herrings
          in a barrel. They were uncomfortable, packed closely together
          and could hardly breathe; but nobody said "Oh!"&mdash;nobody
          grumbled. The consolation of knowing that in a few hours
          they would reach a country where there were no books, no
          schools, and no masters, made them so happy and resigned
          that they felt neither fatigue nor inconvenience, neither hunger,
          nor thirst, nor want of sleep.</p>

     <p>As soon as the coach had drawn up the little man turned
          to Candlewick and with a thousand smirks and grimaces said
          to him, smiling:</p>

     <p>"Tell me, my fine boy, would you also like to go to that
          fortunate country?"</p>

     <p>"I certainly wish to go."</p>

     <p>"But I must warn you, my dear child, that there is not
          a place left in the coach. You can see for yourself that it is
          quite full."</p>

     <p>"No matter," replied Candlewick, "if there is no place
          inside, I will manage to sit on the springs."</p>

     <p>And, giving a leap, he seated himself astride on the
          springs.</p>

     <p>"And you, my love!" said the little man, turning in a
          flattering manner to Pinocchio, "what do you intend to do?
          Are you coming with us or are you going to remain behind?"</p>

     <p>"I remain behind," answered Pinocchio. "I am going
          home. I intend to study, as all well conducted boys do."</p>

     <p>"Much good may it do you!"</p>

     <p>"Pinocchio!" called out Candlewick, "listen to me: come
          with us and we shall have such fun."</p>

     <p>"No, no, no!"</p>

     <p>"Come with us and we shall have such fun," shouted in
          chorus a hundred voices from the inside of the coach.</p>

     <p>"But if I come with you, what will my good Fairy say?"
          said the puppet, who was beginning to yield.</p>

     <p>"Do not trouble your head with melancholy thoughts.
          Consider only that we are going to a country where we shall
          be at liberty to run riot from morning till night."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio did not answer, but he sighed; he sighed again;
          he sighed for the third time, and he said finally:</p>

     <p>"Make a little room for me, for I am coming, too."</p>

     <p>"The places are all full," replied the little man; "but, to
          show you how welcome you are, you shall have my seat on
          the box."</p>

     <p>"And you?"</p>

     <p>"Oh, I will go on foot."</p>

     <p>"No, indeed, I could not allow that. I would rather
          mount one of these donkeys," cried Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>Approaching the right-hand donkey of the first pair, he
          attempted to mount him, but the animal turned on him and,
          giving him a great blow in the stomach, rolled him over with
          his legs in the air.</p>

     <p>You can imagine the impertinent and immoderate laughter
          of all the boys who witnessed this scene.</p>

     <p>But the little man did not laugh. He approached the
          rebellious donkey and, pretending to give him a kiss, bit off
          half of his ear.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio in the meantime had gotten up from the ground
          in a fury and, with a spring, he seated himself on the poor
          animal's back. And he sprang so well that the boys stopped
          laughing and began to shout: "Hurrah, Pinocchio!" and they
          clapped their hands and applauded him as if they would never
          finish.</p>

     <p>Now that Pinocchio was mounted, the coach started.
          Whilst the donkeys were galloping and the coach was rattling
          over the stones of the high road, the puppet thought that he
          heard a low voice that was scarcely audible saying to him:</p>

     <p>"Poor fool! you would follow your own way, but you will
          repent it!"</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, feeling almost frightened, looked from side to
          side to try and discover where these words could come from,
          but he saw nobody. The donkeys galloped, the coach rattled,
          the boys inside slept, Candlewick snored like a dormouse, and
          the little man seated on the box sang between his teeth:</p>

     <div class="poem">
          <div class="stanza">
               <span class="i0">"During the night all sleep,<br /></span>
               <span class="i0">But I sleep never."<br /></span>
          </div>
     </div>

     <p>After they had gone another mile, Pinocchio heard the
          same little low voice saying to him:</p>

     <p>"Bear it in mind, simpleton! Boys who refuse to study
          and turn their backs upon books, schools and masters, to pass
          their time in play and amusement, sooner or later come to a
          bad end. I know it by experience, and I can tell you. A
          day will come when you will weep as I am weeping now, but
          then it will be too late!"</p>

     <p>On hearing these words whispered very softly, the puppet,
          more frightened than ever, sprang down from the back of
          his donkey and went and took hold of his mouth.</p>

     <p>Imagine his surprise when he found that the donkey was
          crying&mdash;crying like a boy!</p>

     <p>"Eh! Sir Coachman," cried Pinocchio to the little man,
          "here is an extraordinary thing! This donkey is crying."</p>

     <p>"Let him cry; he will laugh when he is a bridegroom."</p>

     <p>"But have you by chance taught him to talk?"</p>

     <p>"No; but he spent three years in a company of learned
          dogs, and he learned to mutter a few words."</p>

     <p>"Poor beast!"</p>

     <p>"Come, come," said the little man, "don't let us waste
          time in seeing a donkey cry. Mount him and let us go on:
          the night is cold and the road is long."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio obeyed without another word. In the morning
          about daybreak they arrived safely in the "Land of Boobies."</p>

     <p>It was a country unlike any other country in the world.
          The population was composed entirely of boys. The oldest
          were fourteen, and the youngest scarcely eight years old. In
          the streets there was such merriment, noise and shouting that
          it was enough to turn anybody's head. There were troops of
          boys everywhere. Some were playing with nuts, some with
          battledores, some with balls. Some rode velocipedes, others
          wooden horses. A party were playing at hide and seek, a
          few were chasing each other. Some were reciting, some singing,
          some leaping. Some were amusing themselves with walking
          on their hands with their feet in the air; others were
          trundling hoops or strutting about dressed as generals, wearing
          leaf helmets and commanding a squadron of cardboard soldiers.
          Some were laughing, some shouting, some were calling
          out; others clapped their hands, or whistled, or clucked like
          a hen who has just laid an egg.</p>

     <p>In every square, canvas theaters had been erected and
          they were crowded with boys from morning till evening. On
          the walls of the houses there were inscriptions written in charcoal:
          "Long live playthings, we will have no more schools;
          down with arithmetic," and similar other fine sentiments, all
          in bad spelling.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, Candlewick and the other boys who had made
          the journey with the little man, had scarcely set foot in the
          town before they were in the thick of the tumult, and I need
          not tell you that in a few minutes they had made acquaintance
          with everybody. Where could happier or more contented boys
          be found?</p>

     <p>In the midst of continual games and every variety of
          amusement, the hours, the days and the weeks passed like
          lightning.</p>

     <p>"Oh, what a delightful life!" said Pinocchio, whenever
          by chance he met Candlewick.</p>

     <p>"See, then, if I was not right?" replied the other. "And
          to think that you did not want to come! To think that you
          had taken it into your head to return home to your Fairy,
          and to lose your time in studying! If you are this moment
          free from the bother of books and school, you must acknowledge
          that you owe it to me, to my advice, and to my persuasions.
          It is only friends who know how to render such
          great services."</p>

     <p>"It is true, Candlewick! If I am now a really happy
          boy, it is all your doing. But do you know what the master
          used to say when he talked to me of you? He always said
          to me: 'Do not associate with that rascal Candlewick, for he
          is a bad companion, and will only lead you into mischief!'"</p>

     <p>"Poor master!" replied the other, shaking his head. "I
          know only too well that he disliked me, and amused himself
          by calumniating me; but I am generous and I forgive him!"</p>

     <p>"Noble soul!" said Pinocchio, embracing his friend affectionately
          and kissing him between the eyes.</p>

     <p>This delightful life had gone on for five months. The
          days had been entirely spent in play and amusement, without
          a thought of books or school, when one morning Pinocchio
          awoke to a most disagreeable surprise that put him into a
          very bad humor.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO TURNS INTO A DONKEY</h2>


     <p>The surprise was that Pinocchio, when he awoke, scratched
          his head, and in scratching his head he discovered, to his
          great astonishment, that his ears had grown more than a hand.</p>

     <p>You know that the puppet from his birth had always
          had very small ears&mdash;so small that they were not visible to
          the naked eye. You can imagine then what he felt when he
          found that during the night his ears had become so long that
          they seemed like two brooms.</p>

     <p>He went at once in search of a glass that he might look
          at himself, but, not being able to find one, he filled the basin
          of his washing-stand with water, and he saw reflected what
          he certainly would never have wished to see. He saw his
          head embellished with a magnificent pair of donkey's ears!</p>

     <p>Only think of poor Pinocchio's sorrow, shame and despair!</p>

     <p>He began to cry and roar, and he beat his head against
          the wall, but the more he cried the longer his ears grew; they
          grew, and grew, and became hairy towards the points.</p>

     <p>At the sound of his loud outcries a beautiful little Marmot
          that lived on the first floor came into the room. Seeing the
          puppet in such grief she asked earnestly:</p>

     <p>"What has happened to you, my dear fellow-lodger?"</p>

     <p>"I am ill, my dear little Marmot, very ill, and my illness
          frightens me. Do you understand counting a pulse?"</p>

     <p>"A little."</p>

     <p>"Then feel and see if by chance I have got fever."</p>

     <p>The little Marmot raised her right fore-paw, and, after
          having felt Pinocchio's pulse, she said to him, sighing:</p>

     <p>"My friend, I am grieved to be obliged to give you bad
          news!"</p>

     <p>"What is it?"</p>

     <p>"You have got a very bad fever!"</p>

     <p>"What fever is it?"</p>

     <p>"It is donkey fever."</p>

     <p>"That is a fever that I do not understand," said the puppet,
          but he understood it only too well.</p>

     <p>"Then I will explain it to you," said the Marmot. "You
          must know that in two or three hours you will be no longer
          a puppet, or a boy."</p>

     <p>"Then what shall I be?"</p>

     <p>"In two or three hours you will become really and truly
          a little donkey, like those that draw carts and carry cabbages
          and salad to market."</p>

     <p>"Oh, unfortunate that I am! unfortunate that I am!" cried
          Pinocchio, seizing his two ears with his hands and pulling them
          and tearing them furiously as if they had been some one
          else's ears.</p>

     <p>"My dear boy," said the Marmot, by way of consoling
          him, "you can do nothing. It is destiny. It is written in the
          decrees of wisdom that all boys who are lazy, and who take
          a dislike to books, to schools, and to masters, and who pass
          their time in amusement, games, and diversions, must end
          sooner or later by becoming transformed into so many little
          donkeys."</p>

     <p>"But is it really so?" asked the puppet, sobbing.</p>

     <p>"It is indeed only too true! And tears are now useless.
          You should have thought of it sooner!"</p>

     <p>"But it was not my fault; believe me, little Marmot, the
          fault was all Candlewick's!"</p>

     <p>"And who is this Candlewick?"</p>

     <p>"One of my school-fellows. I wanted to return home; I
          wanted to be obedient. I wished to study, but Candlewick
          said to me: 'Why should you bother yourself by studying?
          Why should you go to school? Come with us instead to the
          "Land of Boobies"; there we shall none of us have to learn;
          there we shall amuse ourselves from morning to night, and
          we shall always be merry'."</p>

     <p>"And why did you follow the advice of that false friend?
          of that bad companion?"</p>

     <p>"Why? Because, my dear little Marmot, I am a puppet
          with no sense, and with no heart. Ah! if I had had the least
          heart I should never have left that good Fairy who loved me
          like a mamma, and who had done so much for me! And I
          would be no longer a puppet, for I would by this time have
          become a little boy like so many others: But if I meet Candlewick,
          woe to him! He shall hear what I think of him!"</p>

     <p>And he turned to go out. But when he reached the door
          he remembered his donkey's ears, and, feeling ashamed to
          show them in public, what do you think he did? He took a
          big cotton cap and, putting it on his head, he pulled it well
          down over the point of his nose.</p>

     <p>He then set out and went everywhere in search of Candlewick.
          He looked for him in the streets, in the squares, in
          the little theaters, in every possible place, but he could not
          find him. He inquired for him of everybody he met, but no
          one had seen him.</p>

     <p>He then went to seek him at his house and, having reached
          the door, he knocked.</p>

     <p>"Who is there?" asked Candlewick from within.</p>

     <p>"It is I!" answered the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Wait a moment and I will let you in."</p>

     <p>After half an hour the door was opened and imagine
          Pinocchio's feelings when, upon going into the room, he saw
          his friend Candlewick with a big cotton cap on his head which
          came down over his nose.</p>

     <p>At the sight of the cap Pinocchio felt almost consoled and
          thought to himself:</p>

     <p>"Has my friend got the same illness that I have? Is he
          also suffering from donkey fever?"</p>

     <p>And, pretending to have observed nothing, he asked him,
          smiling:</p>

     <p>"How are you, my dear Candlewick?"</p>

     <p>"Very well; as well as a mouse in a Parmesan cheese."</p>

     <p>"Are you saying that seriously?"</p>

     <p>"Why should I tell you a lie?"</p>

     <p>"Excuse me; but why, then, do you keep that cotton cap
          on your head which covers up your ears?"</p>

     <p>"The doctor ordered me to wear it because I have hurt
          this knee. And you, dear puppet, why have you got on that
          cotton cap pulled down over your nose?"</p>

     <p>"The doctor prescribed it because I have grazed my foot."</p>

     <p>"Oh, poor Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>"Oh, poor Candlewick!"</p>

     <p>After these words a long silence followed, during which
          the two friends did nothing but look mockingly at each other.</p>

     <p>At last the puppet said in a soft voice to his companion:</p>

     <p>"Satisfy my curiosity, my dear Candlewick: have you
          ever suffered from disease of the ears?"</p>

     <p>"Never! And you?"</p>

     <p>"Never. Only since this morning one of my ears aches."</p>

     <p>"Mine is also paining me."</p>

     <p>"You also? And which of your ears hurts you?"</p>

     <p>"Both of them. And you?"</p>

     <p>"Both of them. Can we have got the same illness?"</p>

     <p>"I fear so."</p>

     <p>"Will you do me a kindness, Candlewick?"</p>

     <p>"Willingly! With all my heart."</p>

     <p>"Will you let me see your ears?"</p>

     <p>"Why not? But first, my dear Pinocchio, I should like
          to see yours."</p>

     <p>"No: you must be first."</p>

     <p>"No, dear. First you and then I!"</p>

     <p>"Well," said the puppet, "let us come to an agreement
          like good friends."</p>

     <p>"Let us hear it."</p>

     <p>"We will both take off our caps at the same moment. Do
          you agree?"</p>

     <p>"I agree."</p>

     <p>"Then, attention!"</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio began to count in a loud voice:</p>

     <p>"One, two, three!"</p>

     <p>At the word "Three!" the two boys took off their caps
          and threw them into the air.</p>

     <p>And then a scene followed that would seem incredible if
          it were not true. That is, that when Pinocchio and Candlewick
          discovered that they were both struck with the same
          misfortune, instead of feeling full of mortification and grief,
          they began to prick their ungainly ears and to make a thousand
          antics, and they ended by going into bursts of laughter.</p>

     <p>And they laughed, and laughed, and laughed, until they
          had to hold themselves together. But in the midst of their
          merriment Candlewick suddenly stopped, staggered, and,
          changing color, said to his friend:</p>

     <p>"Help, help, Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>"What is the matter with you?"</p>

     <p>"Alas, I cannot any longer stand upright."</p>

     <p>"Neither can I," exclaimed Pinocchio, tottering and beginning
          to cry.</p>

     <p>And whilst they were talking, they both doubled up and
          began to run round the room on their hands and feet. And
          as they ran, their hands became hoofs, their faces lengthened
          into muzzles, and their backs became covered with a light gray
          hairy coat sprinkled with black.</p>

     <p>But do you know what was the worst moment for these
          two wretched boys? The worst and the most humiliating moment
          was when their tails grew. Vanquished by shame and
          sorrow, they wept and lamented their fate.</p>

     <p>Oh, if they had but been wiser! But instead of sighs and
          lamentations they could only bray like asses; and they brayed
          loudly and said in chorus: "Hee-haw!"</p>

     <p>Whilst this was going on some one knocked at the door
          and a voice on the outside said:</p>

     <p>"Open the door! I am the little man, I am the coachman
          who brought you to this country. Open at once, or it will
          be the worse for you!"</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO IS TRAINED FOR THE CIRCUS</h2>


     <p>Finding that the door remained shut the little man burst
          it open with a violent kick and, coming into the room, he
          said to Pinocchio and Candlewick with his usual little laugh:</p>

     <p>"Well done, boys! You brayed well, and I recognized
          you by your voices. That is why I am here."</p>

     <p>At these words the two little donkeys were quite stupefied
          and stood with their heads down, their ears lowered, and their
          tails between their legs.</p>

     <p>At first the little man stroked and caressed them; then,
          taking out a currycomb, he currycombed them well. And
          when by this process he had polished them till they shone like
          two mirrors, he put a halter round their necks and led them
          to the market-place, in hopes of selling them and making a
          good profit.</p>

     <p>And indeed buyers were not wanting. Candlewick was
          bought by a peasant whose donkey had died the previous day.
          Pinocchio was sold to the director of a company of buffoons
          and tight-rope dancers, who bought him that he might teach
          him to leap and to dance with the other animals belonging to
          the company.</p>

     <p>And now, my little readers, you will have understood the
          fine trade that little man pursued. The wicked little monster,
          who had a face all milk and honey, made frequent journeys
          round the world with his coach. As he went along he collected,
          with promises and flattery, all the idle boys who had
          taken a dislike to books and school. As soon as his coach was
          full he conducted them to the "Land of Boobies," that they
          might pass their time in games, in uproar, and in amusement.
          When these poor, deluded boys, from continual play and no
          study, had become so many little donkeys, he took possession
          of them with great delight and satisfaction, and carried them
          off to the fairs and markets to be sold. And in this way he
          had in a few years made heaps of money and had become a
          millionaire.</p>

     <p>What became of Candlewick I do not know, but I do
          know that Pinocchio from the very first day had to endure a
          very hard, laborious life.</p>

     <p>When he was put into his stall his master filled the
          manger with straw; but Pinocchio, having tried a mouthful,
          spat it out again.</p>

     <p>Then his master, grumbling, filled the manger with hay;
          but neither did the hay please him.</p>

     <p>"Ah!" exclaimed his master in a passion. "Does not hay
          please you either? Leave it to me, my fine donkey; if you
          are so full of caprices I will find a way to cure you!"</p>

     <p>And by way of correcting him he struck his legs with
          his whip.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio began to cry and to bray with pain, and he
          said, braying:</p>

     <p>"Hee-haw! I cannot digest straw!"</p>

     <p>"Then eat hay!" said his master, who understood perfectly
          the asinine dialect.</p>

     <p>"Hee-haw! hay gives me a pain in my stomach."</p>

     <p>"Do you mean to pretend that a little donkey like you
          must be kept on breasts of chickens, and capons in jelly?"
          asked his master, getting more and more angry, and whipping
          him again.</p>

     <p>At this second whipping Pinocchio prudently held his
          tongue and said nothing more.</p>

     <p>The stable was then shut and Pinocchio was left alone.
          He had not eaten for many hours and he began to yawn from
          hunger. And when he yawned he opened a mouth that seemed
          as wide as an oven.</p>

     <p>At last, finding nothing else in the manger, he resigned
          himself and chewed a little hay; and after he had chewed it
          well, he shut his eyes and swallowed it.</p>

     <p>"This hay is not bad," he said to himself; "but how much
          better it would have been if I had gone on with my studies!
          Instead of hay I might now be eating a hunch of new bread
          and a fine slice of sausage. But I must have patience!"</p>

     <p>The next morning when he woke he looked in the manger
          for a little more hay; but he found none, for he had eaten
          it all during the night.</p>

     <p>Then he took a mouthful of chopped straw, but whilst
          he was chewing it he had to acknowledge that the taste of
          chopped straw did not in the least resemble a savory dish
          of macaroni or pie.</p>

     <p>"But I must have patience!" he repeated as he went on
          chewing. "May my example serve at least as a warning to
          all disobedient boys who do not want to study. Patience!"</p>

     <p>"Patience indeed!" shouted his master, coming at that
          moment into the stable. "Do you think, my little donkey, that
          I bought you only to give you food and drink? I bought you
          to make you work, and that you might earn money for me.
          Up, then, at once! you must come with me into the circus, and
          there I will teach you to jump through hoops, to go through
          frames of paper head foremost, to dance waltzes and polkas,
          and to stand upright on your hind legs."</p>

     <p>Poor Pinocchio, either by love or by force, had to learn
          all these fine things. But it took him three months before
          he had learned them, and he got many a whipping that nearly
          took off his skin.</p>

     <p>At last a day came when his master was able to announce
          that he would give a really extraordinary representation. The
          many colored placards stuck on the street corners were thus
          worded:<br /><br /></p>

     <p>On that evening, as you may imagine, an hour before
          the play was to begin the theater was crammed.</p>

     <p>There was not a place to be had either in the pit or the
          stalls, or in the boxes even, by paying its weight in gold.</p>

     <p>The benches round the circus were crowded with children
          and with boys of all ages, who were in a fever of impatience
          to see the famous little donkey Pinocchio dance.</p>

     <p>When the first part of the performance was over, the
          director of the company, dressed in a black coat, white breeches,
          and big leather boots that came above his knees, presented
          himself to the public, and, after making a profound bow, he
          began with much solemnity the following ridiculous speech:</p>

     <p>"Respectable public, ladies and gentlemen! The humble
          undersigned being a passer-by in this illustrious city, I have
          wished to procure for myself the honor, not to say the pleasure,
          of presenting to this intelligent and distinguished audience a
          celebrated little donkey, who has already had the honor of
          dancing in the presence of His Majesty the Emperor of all
          the principal courts of Europe.</p>

     <p>"And, thanking you, I beg of you to help us with your
          inspiring presence and to be indulgent to us."</p>

     <p>This speech was received with much laughter and applause,
          but the applause redoubled and became tumultuous when the
          little donkey Pinocchio made his appearance in the middle of
          the circus. He was decked out for the occasion. He had a
          new bridle of polished leather with brass buckles and studs,
          and two white camelias in his ears. His mane was divided and
          curled, and each curl was tied with bows of colored ribbon.
          He had a girth of gold and silver round his body, and his tail
          was plaited with amaranth and blue velvet ribbons. He was,
          in fact, a little donkey to fall in love with!</p>

     <p>The director, in presenting him to the public, added these
          few words:</p>

     <p>"My respectable auditors! I am not here to tell you
          falsehoods of the great difficulties that I have overcome in
          understanding and subjugating this mammifer, whilst he was
          grazing at liberty amongst the mountains in the plains of the
          torrid zone. I beg you will observe the wild rolling of his
          eyes. Every means having been tried in vain to tame him,
          and to accustom him to the life of domestic quadrupeds, I
          was often forced to have recourse to the convincing argument
          of the whip. But all my goodness to him, instead of gaining
          his affections, has, on the contrary, increased his viciousness.
          However, following the system of Gall, I discovered in his
          cranium a bony cartilage that the Faculty of Medicine of Paris
          has itself recognized as the regenerating bulb of the hair, and
          of dance. For this reason I have not only taught him to dance,
          but also to jump through hoops and through frames covered
          with paper. Admire him, and then pass your opinion on him!
          But before taking my leave of you, permit me, ladies and
          gentlemen, to invite you to the daily performance that will
          take place tomorrow evening; but in case the weather should
          threaten rain, the performance will be postponed till tomorrow
          morning at 11 ante-meridian of post-meridian."</p>

     <p>Here the director made another profound bow, and, then
          turning to Pinocchio, he said:</p>

     <p>"Courage, Pinocchio! before you begin your feats make
          your bow to this distinguished audience&mdash;ladies, gentlemen, and
          children."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio obeyed, and bent both his knees till they touched
          the ground, and remained kneeling until the director, cracking
          his whip, shouted to him:</p>

     <p>"At a foot's pace!"</p>

     <p>Then the little donkey raised himself on his four legs and
          began to walk round the theater, keeping at a foot's pace.</p>

     <p>After a little the director cried:</p>

     <p>"Trot!" and Pinocchio, obeying the order, changed to
          a trot.</p>

     <p>"Gallop!" and Pinocchio broke into a gallop.</p>

     <p>"Full gallop!" and Pinocchio went full gallop. But whilst
          he was going full speed like a race horse the director, raising
          his arm in the air, fired off a pistol.</p>

     <p>At the shot the little donkey, pretending to be wounded,
          fell his whole length in the circus, as if he were really dying.</p>

     <p>As he got up from the ground amidst an outburst of
          applause, shouts and clapping of hands, he naturally raised his
          head and looked up, and he saw in one of the boxes a beautiful
          lady who wore round her neck a thick gold chain from
          which hung a medallion. On the medallion was painted the
          portrait of a puppet.</p>

     <p>"That is my portrait! That lady is the Fairy!" said Pinocchio
          to himself, recognizing her immediately; and, overcome
          with delight, he tried to cry:</p>

     <p>"Oh, my little Fairy! Oh, my little Fairy!"</p>

     <p>But instead of these words a bray came from his throat,
          so sonorous and so prolonged that all the spectators laughed,
          and more especially all the children who were in the theater.</p>

     <p>Then the director, to give him a lesson, and to make him
          understand that it is not good manners to bray before the
          public, gave him a blow on his nose with the handle of his whip.</p>

     <p>The poor little donkey put his tongue out an inch and
          licked his nose for at least five minutes, thinking perhaps that
          it would ease the pain he felt.</p>

     <p>But what was his despair when, looking up a second time,
          he saw that the box was empty and that the Fairy had disappeared!</p>

     <p>He thought he was going to die; his eyes filled with tears
          and he began to weep. Nobody, however, noticed it, and
          least of all the director who, cracking his whip, shouted:</p>

     <p>"Courage, Pinocchio! Now let the audience see how
          gracefully you can jump through the hoops."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio tried two or three times, but each time that
          he came in front of the hoop, instead of going through it, he
          found it easier to go under it. At last he made a leap and
          went through it, but his right leg unfortunately caught in the
          hoop, and that caused him to fall to the ground doubled up
          in a heap on the other side.</p>

     <p>When he got up he was lame and it was only with great
          difficulty that he managed to return to the stable.</p>

     <p>"Bring out Pinocchio! We want the little donkey! Bring
          out the little donkey!" shouted all the boys in the theater,
          touched and sorry for the sad accident.</p>

     <p>But the little donkey was seen no more that evening.</p>

     <p>The following morning the veterinary, that is, the doctor
          of animals, paid him a visit, and declared that he would
          remain lame for life.</p>

     <p>The director then said to the stable-boy:</p>

     <p>"What do you suppose I can do with a lame donkey?
          He would eat food without earning it. Take him to the
          market and sell him."</p>

     <p>When they reached the market a purchaser was found
          at once. He asked the stable-boy:</p>

     <p>"How much do you want for that lame donkey?"</p>

     <p>"Twenty dollars."</p>

     <p>"I will give you two dollars. Don't suppose that I am
          buying him to make use of; I am buying him solely for his
          skin. I see that his skin is very hard and I intend to make
          a drum with it for the band of my village."</p>

     <p>Imagine poor Pinocchio's feelings when he heard that he
          was destined to become a drum!</p>

     <p>As soon as the purchaser had paid his two dollars he
          conducted the little donkey to the seashore. He then put a
          stone round his neck and, tying a rope, the end of which he
          held in his hand, round his leg, he gave him a sudden push
          and threw him into the water.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio, weighted down by the stone, went at once to
          the bottom, and his owner, keeping tight hold of the cord,
          sat down quietly on a piece of rock to wait until the little
          donkey was drowned, intending then to skin him.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO IS SWALLOWED BY THE DOG-FISH</h2>


     <p>After Pinocchio had been fifty minutes under the water,
          his purchaser said aloud to himself:</p>

     <p>"My poor little lame donkey must by this time be quite
          drowned. I will therefore pull him out of the water, and I
          will make a fine drum of his skin."</p>

     <p>And he began to haul in the rope that he had tied to
          the donkey's leg, and he hauled, and hauled, and hauled, until
          at last&mdash;what do you think appeared above the water? Instead
          of a little dead donkey he saw a live puppet, who was wriggling
          like an eel.</p>

     <p>Seeing this wooden puppet, the poor man thought he was
          dreaming, and, struck dumb with astonishment, he remained
          with his mouth open and his eyes starting out of his head.</p>

     <p>Having somewhat recovered from his first stupefaction,
          he asked in a quavering voice:</p>

     <p>"And the little donkey that I threw into the sea? What
          has become of him?"</p>

     <p>"I am the little donkey!" said Pinocchio, laughing.</p>

     <p>"You?"</p>

     <p>"I."</p>

     <p>"Ah, you young scamp!! Do you dare to make game
          of me?"</p>

     <p>"To make game of you? Quite the contrary, my dear
          master? I am speaking seriously."</p>

     <p>"But how can you, who but a short time ago were a little
          donkey, have become a wooden puppet, only from having been
          left in the water?"</p>

     <p>"It must have been the effect of sea water. The sea makes
          extraordinary changes."</p>

     <p>"Beware, puppet, beware! Don't imagine that you can
          amuse yourself at my expense. Woe to you if I lose patience!"</p>

     <p>"Well, master, do you wish to know the true story?
          If you will set my leg free I will tell it you."</p>

     <p>The good man, who was curious to hear the true story,
          immediately untied the knot that kept him bound; and Pinocchio,
          finding himself free as a bird in the air, commenced as
          follows:</p>

     <p>"You must know that I was once a puppet as I am now,
          and I was on the point of becoming a boy like the many who
          are in the world. But instead, induced by my dislike for study
          and the advice of bad companions, I ran away from home.
          One fine day when I awoke I found myself changed into a
          donkey with long ears, and a long tail. What a disgrace it
          was to me!&mdash;a disgrace, dear master, that even your worst
          enemy would not inflict upon you! Taken to the market to
          be sold I was bought by the director of an equestrian company,
          who took it into his head to make a famous dancer of me, and
          a famous leaper through hoops. But one night during a performance
          I had a bad fall in the circus and lamed both my
          legs. Then the director, not knowing what to do with a lame
          donkey, sent me to be sold, and you were the purchaser!"</p>

     <p>"Only too true. And I paid two dollars for you. And
          now, who will give me back my good money?"</p>

     <p>"And why did you buy me? You bought me to make a
          drum of my skin!"</p>

     <p>"Only too true! And now, where shall I find another
          skin?"</p>

     <p>"Don't despair, master. There are such a number of little
          donkeys in the world!"</p>

     <p>"Tell me, you impertinent rascal, does your story end
          here?"</p>

     <p>"No," answered the puppet; "I have another two words
          to say and then I shall have finished. After you had bought
          me you brought me to this place to kill me; but then, yielding
          to a feeling of compassion, you preferred to tie a stone round
          my neck and to throw me into the sea. This humane feeling
          does you great honor and I shall always be grateful to you
          for it. But, nevertheless, dear master, this time you made
          your calculations without considering the Fairy!"</p>

     <p>"And who is the Fairy?"</p>

     <p>"She is my mamma and she resembles all other good
          mammas who care for their children, and who never lose sight
          of them, but help them lovingly, even when, on account of
          their foolishness and evil conduct, they deserve to be abandoned
          and left to themselves. Well, then, the good Fairy, as
          soon as she saw that I was in danger of drowning, sent immediately
          an immense shoal of fish, who, believing me really to
          be a little dead donkey, began to eat me. And what mouthfuls
          they took; I should never have thought that fish were
          greedier than boys! Some ate my ears, some my muzzle, others
          my neck and mane, some the skin of my legs, some my coat.
          Amongst them there was a little fish so polite that he even
          condescended to eat my tail."</p>

     <p>"From this time forth," said his purchaser, horrified, "I
          swear that I will never touch fish. It would be too dreadful
          to open a mullet, or a fried whiting, and to find inside a
          donkey's tail!"</p>

     <p>"I agree with you," said the puppet, laughing. "However,
          I must tell you that when the fish had finished eating the
          donkey's hide that covered me from head to foot, they naturally
          reached the bone, or rather the wood, for, as you see, I am
          made of the hardest wood. But after giving a few bites they
          soon discovered that I was not a morsel for their teeth, and,
          disgusted with such indigestible food, they went off, some in
          one direction and some in another, without so much as saying
          'Thank you' to me. And now, at last, I have told you how
          it was that when you pulled up the rope you found a live
          puppet instead of a dead donkey."</p>

     <p>"I laugh at your story," cried the man in a rage. "I
          know only that I spent two dollars to buy you, and I will
          have my money back. Shall I tell you what I will do? I
          will take you back to the market and I will sell you by weight
          as seasoned wood for lighting fires."</p>

     <p>"Sell me if you like; I am content," said Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>But as he said it he made a spring and plunged into the
          water. Swimming gaily away from the shore, he called to his
          poor owner:</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, master; if you should be in want of a skin to
          make a drum, remember me."</p>

     <p>And he laughed and went on swimming, and after a while
          he turned again and shouted louder:</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, master; if you should be in want of a little
          well seasoned wood for lighting the fire, remember me."</p>

     <p>In the twinkling of an eye he had swum so far off that he
          was scarcely visible. All that could be seen of him was a little
          black speck on the surface of the sea that from time to time
          lifted its legs out of the water and leaped and capered like
          a dolphin enjoying himself.</p>

     <p>Whilst Pinocchio was swimming, he knew not whither, he
          saw in the midst of the sea a rock that seemed to be made
          of white marble, and on the summit there stood a beautiful
          little goat who bleated lovingly and made signs to him to
          approach.</p>

     <p>But the most singular thing was this. The little goat's
          hair, instead of being white or black, or a mixture of two colors
          as is usual with other goats, was blue, and a very vivid blue,
          greatly resembling the hair of the beautiful Child.</p>

     <p>I leave you to imagine how rapidly poor Pinocchio's heart
          began to beat. He swam with redoubled strength and energy
          towards the white rock; and he was already half-way there
          when he saw, rising up out of the water and coming to meet
          him, the horrible head of a sea-monster. His wide-open, cavernous
          mouth and his three rows of enormous teeth would have
          been terrifying to look at even in a picture.</p>

     <p>And do you know what this sea-monster was?</p>

     <p>This sea-monster was neither more nor less than that
          gigantic Dog-Fish, who has been mentioned many times in this
          story, and who, for his slaughter and for his insatiable voracity,
          had been named the "Attila of Fish and Fishermen."</p>

     <p>Only to think of poor Pinocchio's terror at the sight of
          the monster. He tried to avoid it, to change his direction; he
          tried to escape, but that immense, wide-open mouth came
          towards him with the velocity of an arrow.</p>

     <p>"Be quick, Pinocchio, for pity's sake!" cried the beautiful
          little goat, bleating.</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio swam desperately with his arms, his chest,
          his legs, and his feet.</p>

     <p>"Quick, Pinocchio, the monster is close upon you!"</p>

     <p>And Pinocchio swam quicker than ever, and flew on with
          the rapidity of a ball from a gun. He had nearly reached the
          rock, and the little goat, leaning over towards the sea, had
          stretched out her fore-legs to help him out of the water!</p>

     <p>But it was too late! The monster had overtaken him and,
          drawing in his breath, he sucked in the poor puppet as he
          would have sucked a hen's egg; and he swallowed him with
          such violence and avidity that Pinocchio, in falling into the
          Dog-Fish's stomach, received such a blow that he remained
          unconscious for a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>

     <p>When he came to himself again after the shock he could
          not in the least imagine in what world he was. All around
          him it was quite dark, and the darkness was so black and so
          profound that it seemed to him that he had fallen head downwards
          into an inkstand full of ink. He listened, but he
          could hear no noise; only from time to time great gusts of
          wind blew in his face. At first he could not understand where
          the wind came from, but at last he discovered that it came
          out of the monster's lungs. For you must know that the
          Dog-Fish suffered very much from asthma, and when he
          breathed it was exactly as if a north wind was blowing.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio at first tried to keep up his courage, but when
          he had one proof after another that he was really shut up in
          the body of this sea-monster he began to cry and scream, and
          to sob out:</p>

     <p>"Help! help! Oh, how unfortunate I am! Will nobody
          come to save me?"</p>

     <p>"Who do you think could save you, unhappy wretch?"
          said a voice in the dark that sounded like a guitar out of tune.</p>

     <p>"Who is speaking?" asked Pinocchio, frozen with terror.</p>

     <p>"It is I! I am a poor Tunny who was swallowed by the
          Dog-Fish at the same time that you were. And what fish
          are you?"</p>

     <p>"I have nothing in common with fish. I am a puppet."</p>

     <p>"Then, if you are not a fish, why did you let yourself
          be swallowed by the monster?"</p>

     <p>"I didn't let myself be swallowed; it was the monster
          swallowed me! And now, what are we to do here in the dark?"</p>

     <p>"Resign ourselves and wait until the Dog-Fish has digested
          us both."</p>

     <p>"But I do not want to be digested!" howled Pinocchio,
          beginning to cry again.</p>

     <p>"Neither do I want to be digested," added the Tunny;
          "but I am enough of a philosopher to console myself by
          thinking that when one is born a Tunny it is more dignified
          to die in the water than in oil."</p>

     <p>"That is all nonsense!" cried Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"It is my opinion," replied the Tunny, "and opinions, so
          say the political Tunnies, ought to be respected."</p>

     <p>"To sum it all up, I want to get away from here. I
          want to escape."</p>

     <p>"Escape, if you are able!"</p>

     <p>"Is this Dog-Fish who has swallowed us very big?" asked
          the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Big! Why, only imagine, his body is two miles long
          without counting his tail."</p>

     <p>Whilst they were holding this conversation in the dark,
          Pinocchio thought that he saw a light a long way off.</p>

     <p>"What is that little light I see in the distance?" he asked.</p>

     <p>"It is most likely some companion in misfortune who is
          waiting, like us, to be digested."</p>

     <p>"I will go and find him. Do you not think that it may
          by chance be some old fish who perhaps could show us how
          to escape?"</p>

     <p>"I hope it may be so, with all my heart, dear puppet."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, Tunny."</p>

     <p>"Good-bye, puppet, and good fortune attend you."</p>

     <p>"Where shall we meet again?"</p>

     <p>"Who can say? It is better not even to think of it!"</p>

     <h2>A HAPPY SURPRISE FOR PINOCCHIO</h2>


     <p>Pinocchio, having taken leave of his friend the Tunny,
          began to grope his way in the dark through the body of
          the Dog-Fish, taking a step at a time in the direction of the
          light that he saw shining dimly at a great distance.</p>

     <p>The farther he advanced the brighter became the light;
          and he walked and walked until at last he reached it; and
          when he reached it&mdash;what did he find? I will give you a
          thousand guesses. He found a little table spread out and on
          it a lighted candle stuck into a green glass bottle, and, seated
          at the table, was a little old man. He was eating some live
          fish, and they were so very much alive that whilst he was
          eating them they sometimes even jumped out of his mouth.</p>

     <p>At this sight Pinocchio was filled with such great and
          unexpected joy that he became almost delirious. He wanted
          to laugh, he wanted to cry, he wanted to say a thousand things,
          and instead he could only stammer out a few confused and
          broken words. At last he succeeded in uttering a cry of joy,
          and, opening his arms, he threw them around the little old
          man's neck, and began to shout:</p>

     <p>"Oh, my dear papa! I have found you at last! I will
          never leave you more, never more, never more!"</p>

     <p>"Then my eyes tell me true?" said the little old man,
          rubbing his eyes; "then you are really my dear Pinocchio?"</p>

     <p>"Yes, yes, I am Pinocchio, really Pinocchio! And you
          have quite forgiven me, have you not? Oh, my dear papa,
          how good you are! And to think that I, on the contrary&mdash;Oh!
          but if you only knew what misfortunes have been poured
          on my head, and all that has befallen me! Only imagine, the
          day that you, poor, dear papa, sold your coat to buy me a
          spelling-book, that I might go to school, I escaped to see the
          puppet show, and the showman wanted to put me on the fire,
          that I might roast his mutton, and he was the same that afterwards
          gave me five gold pieces to take them to you, but I
          met the Fox and the Cat, who took me to the inn of The
          Red Craw-Fish, where they ate like wolves, and I left by
          myself in the middle of the night, and I encountered assassins
          who ran after me, and I ran away, and they followed,
          and I ran, and they always followed me, and I ran, until they
          hung me to a branch of a Big Oak, and the beautiful Child
          with blue hair sent a little carriage to fetch me, and the doctors
          when they saw me said immediately, 'If he is not dead, it is
          a proof that he is still alive'&mdash;and then by chance I told a lie,
          and my nose began to grow until I could no longer get through
          the door of the room, for which reason I went with the Fox
          and the Cat to bury the four gold pieces, for one I had spent
          at the inn, and the Parrot began to laugh, and instead of two
          thousand gold pieces I found none left, for which reason the
          judge when he heard that I had been robbed had me immediately
          put in prison to content the robbers, and then when I
          was coming away I saw a beautiful bunch of grapes in a field,
          and I was caught in a trap, and the peasant, who was quite
          right, put a dog-collar round my neck that I might guard the
          poultry-yard, and acknowledging my innocence let me go, and
          the Serpent with the smoking tail began to laugh and broke a
          blood-vessel in his chest, and so I returned to the house of
          the beautiful Child, who was dead, and the Pigeon, seeing that
          I was crying, said to me, 'I have seen your father who was
          building a little boat to go in search of you,' and I said to
          him, 'Oh! if I also had wings,' and he said to me, 'Do you
          want to go to your father?' and I said, 'Without doubt! but
          who will take me to him?' and he said to me, 'I will take you,'
          and I said to him, 'How?' and he said to me, 'Get on my
          back,' and so we flew all night, and then in the morning all
          the fishermen who were looking out to sea said to me, 'There
          is a poor man in a boat who is on the point of being drowned,'
          and I recognized you at once, even at that distance, for my
          heart told me, and I made signs to you to return to land."</p>

     <p>"I also recognized you," said Geppetto, "and I would
          willingly have returned to the shore, but what was I to do!
          The sea was tremendous and a great wave upset my boat.
          Then a horrible Dog-Fish, who was near, as soon as he saw
          me in the water, came towards me, and, putting out his tongue,
          took hold of me and swallowed me as if I had been a little
          apple tart."</p>

     <p>"And how long have you been shut up here?" asked
          Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Since that day&mdash;it must be nearly two years ago; two
          years, my dear Pinocchio, that have seemed like two centuries!"</p>

     <p>"And how have you managed to live? And where did
          you get the candle? And the matches to light it? Who gave
          them to you?"</p>

     <p>"Stop, and I will tell you everything. You must know,
          then, that in the same storm in which my boat was upset a
          merchant vessel foundered. The sailors were all saved, but
          the vessel went to the bottom, and the Dog-Fish, who had that
          day an excellent appetite, after he had swallowed me, swallowed
          also the vessel."</p>

     <p>"How?"</p>

     <p>"He swallowed it in one mouthful, and the only thing
          that he spat out was the mainmast, that had stuck between
          his teeth like a fish-bone. Fortunately for me, the vessel was
          laden with preserved meat in tins, biscuit, bottles of wine,
          dried raisins, cheese, coffee, sugar, candles, and boxes of wax
          matches. With this providential supply I have been able to
          live for two years. But I have arrived at the end of my
          resources; there is nothing left in the larder, and this candle
          that you see burning is the last that remains."</p>

     <p>"And after that?"</p>

     <p>"After that, dear boy, we shall both remain in the dark."</p>

     <p>"Then, dear little papa," said Pinocchio, "there is no time
          to lose. We must think of escaping."</p>

     <p>"Of escaping? How?"</p>

     <p>"We must escape through the mouth of the Dog-Fish,
          throw ourselves into the sea and swim away."</p>

     <p>"You talk well; but, dear Pinocchio, I don't know how
          to swim."</p>

     <p>"What does that matter? I am a good swimmer, and
          you can get on my shoulders and I will carry you safely
          to shore."</p>

     <p>"All illusions, my boy!" replied Geppetto, shaking his
          head, with a melancholy smile. "Do you suppose it possible
          that a puppet like you, scarcely a yard high, could have the
          strength to swim with me on his shoulders!"</p>

     <p>"Try it and you will see!"</p>

     <p>Without another word Pinocchio took the candle in his
          hand, and, going in front to light the way, he said to his father:</p>

     <p>"Follow me, and don't be afraid."</p>

     <p>And they walked for some time and traversed the body
          and the stomach of the Dog-Fish. But when they had arrived
          at the point where the monster's big throat began, they thought
          it better to stop to give a good look around and to choose the
          best moment for escaping.</p>

     <p>Now, I must tell you that the Dog-Fish, being very old,
          and suffering from asthma and palpitation of the heart, was
          obliged to sleep with his mouth open. Pinocchio, therefore,
          having approached the entrance to his throat, and, looking up,
          could see beyond the enormous gaping mouth a large piece of
          starry sky and beautiful moonlight.</p>

     <p>"This is the moment to escape," he whispered, turning to
          his father; "the Dog-Fish is sleeping like a dormouse, the sea
          is calm, and it is as light as day. Follow me, dear papa, and
          in a short time we shall be in safety."</p>

     <p>They immediately climbed up the throat of the sea-monster,
          and, having reached his immense mouth, they began to
          walk on tiptoe down his tongue.</p>

     <p>Before taking the final leap the puppet said to his father:</p>

     <p>"Get on my shoulders and put your arms tightly around
          my neck. I will take care of the rest."</p>

     <p>As soon as Geppetto was firmly settled on his son's shoulders,
          Pinocchio, feeling sure of himself, threw himself into the
          water and began to swim. The sea was as smooth as oil, the
          moon shone brilliantly, and the Dog-Fish was sleeping so
          profoundly that even a cannonade would have failed to wake
          him.</p>

     <h2>PINOCCHIO AT LAST CEASES TO BE A PUPPET
          AND BECOMES A BOY</h2>


     <p>Whilst Pinocchio was swimming quickly towards the
          shore he discovered that his father, who was on his
          shoulders with his legs in the water, was trembling as violently
          as if the poor man had an attack of ague fever.</p>

     <p>Was he trembling from cold or from fear. Perhaps a
          little from both the one and the other. But Pinocchio, thinking
          it was from fear, said, to comfort him:</p>

     <p>"Courage, papa! In a few minutes we shall be safely
          on shore."</p>

     <p>"But where is this blessed shore?" asked the little old man,
          becoming still more frightened, and screwing up his eyes as
          tailors do when they wish to thread a needle. "I have been
          looking in every direction and I see nothing but the sky and
          the sea."</p>

     <p>"But I see the shore as well," said the puppet. "You must
          know that I am like a cat: I see better by night than by day."</p>

     <p>Poor Pinocchio was making a pretense of being in good
          spirits, but in reality he was beginning to feel discouraged;
          his strength was failing, he was gasping and panting for breath.
          He could do no more, and the shore was still far off.</p>

     <p>He swam until he had no breath left; then he turned his
          head to Geppetto and said in broken words?</p>

     <p>"Papa, help me, I am dying!"</p>

     <p>The father and son were on the point of drowning when
          they heard a voice like a guitar out of tune saying:</p>

     <p>"Who is it that is dying?"</p>

     <p>"It is I, and my poor father!"</p>

     <p>"I know that voice! You are Pinocchio!"</p>

     <p>"Precisely; and you?"</p>

     <p>"I am the Tunny, your prison companion in the body of
          the Dog-Fish."</p>

     <p>"And how did you manage to escape?"</p>

     <p>"I followed your example. You showed me the road, and
          I escaped after you."</p>

     <p>"Tunny, you have arrived at the right moment! I implore
          you to help us or we are lost."</p>

     <p>"Willingly and with all my heart. You must, both of you,
          take hold of my tail and leave it to me to guide you. I will take
          you on shore in four minutes."</p>

     <p>Geppetto and Pinocchio, as I need not tell you, accepted
          the offer at once; but, instead of holding on by his tail, they
          thought it would be more comfortable to get on the Tunny's
          back.</p>

     <p>Having reached the shore, Pinocchio sprang first on land
          that he might help his father to do the same. He then turned
          to the Tunny and said to him in a voice full of emotion:</p>

     <p>"My friend, you have saved my papa's life. I can find
          no words with which to thank you properly. Permit me at least
          to give you a kiss as a sign of my eternal gratitude!"</p>

     <p>The Tunny put his head out of the water and Pinocchio,
          kneeling on the ground, kissed him tenderly on the mouth. At
          this spontaneous proof of warm affection, the poor Tunny,
          who was not accustomed to it, felt extremely touched, and,
          ashamed to let himself be seen crying like a child, he plunged
          under the water and disappeared.</p>

     <p>By this time the day had dawned. Pinocchio, then offering
          his arm to Geppetto, who had scarcely breath to stand,
          said to him:</p>

     <p>"Lean on my arm, dear papa, and let us go. We will
          walk very slowly, like the ants, and when we are tired we can
          rest by the wayside."</p>

     <p>"And where shall we go?" asked Geppetto.</p>

     <p>"In search of some house or cottage, where they will give
          us for charity a mouthful of bread, and a little straw to serve
          as a bed."</p>

     <p>They had not gone a hundred yards when they saw by
          the roadside two villainous-looking individuals begging.</p>

     <p>They were the Cat and the Fox, but they were scarcely
          recognizable. Fancy! the Cat had so long feigned blindness
          that she had become blind in reality; and the Fox, old, mangy,
          and with one side paralyzed, had not even his tail left. That
          sneaking thief, having fallen into the most squalid misery, one
          fine day had found himself obliged to sell his beautiful tail to
          a traveling peddler, who bought it to drive away flies.</p>

     <p>"Oh, Pinocchio!" cried the Fox, "give a little in charity
          to two poor, infirm people."</p>

     <p>"Infirm people," repeated the Cat.</p>

     <p>"Begone, impostors!" answered the puppet. "You took
          me in once, but you will never catch me again."</p>

     <p>"Believe me, Pinocchio, we are now poor and unfortunate
          indeed!"</p>

     <p>"If you are poor, you deserve it. Recollect the proverb:
          'Stolen money never fructifies.' Begone, impostors!"</p>

     <p>And, thus saying, Pinocchio and Geppetto went their way
          in peace. When they had gone another hundred yards they
          saw, at the end of a path in the middle of the fields, a nice
          little straw hut with a roof of tiles and bricks.</p>

     <p>"That hut must be inhabited by some one," said Pinocchio.
          "Let us go and knock at the door."</p>

     <p>They went and knocked.</p>

     <p>"We are a poor father and son without bread and without
          a roof," answered the puppet.</p>

     <p>"Turn the key and the door will open," said the same
          little voice.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio turned the key and the door opened. They
          went in and looked here, there, and everywhere, but could see
          no one.</p>

     <p>"Oh! where is the master of the house?" said Pinocchio,
          much surprised.</p>

     <p>"Here I am, up here!"</p>

     <p>The father and son looked immediately up to the ceiling,
          and there on a beam they saw the Talking-Cricket.</p>

     <p>"Oh, my dear little Cricket!" said Pinocchio, bowing politely
          to him.</p>

     <p>"Ah! now you call me 'Your dear little Cricket.' But
          do you remember the time when you threw the handle of a
          hammer at me, to drive me from your house?"</p>

     <p>"You are right, Cricket! Drive me away also! Throw
          the handle of a hammer at me, but have pity on my poor papa."</p>

     <p>"I will have pity on both father and son, but I wished
          to remind you of the ill treatment I received from you, to
          teach you that in this world, when it is possible, we should
          show courtesy to everybody, if we wish it to be extended to
          us in our hour of need."</p>

     <p>"You are right. Cricket, you are right, and I will bear
          in mind the lesson you have given me. But tell me how you
          managed to buy this beautiful hut."</p>

     <p>"This hut was given to me yesterday by a goat whose
          wool was of a beautiful blue color."</p>

     <p>"And where has the goat gone?" asked Pinocchio, with
          lively curiosity.</p>

     <p>"I do not know."</p>

     <p>"And when will it come back?"</p>

     <p>"It will never come back. It went away yesterday in
          great grief and, bleating, it seemed to say: 'Poor Pinocchio!
          I shall never see him more, for by this time the Dog-Fish
          must have devoured him!'"</p>

     <p>"Did it really say that? Then it was she! It was my
          dear little Fairy," exclaimed Pinocchio, crying and sobbing.</p>

     <p>When he had cried for some time he dried his eyes and
          prepared a comfortable bed of straw for Geppetto to lie down
          upon. Then he asked the Cricket:</p>

     <p>"Tell me, little Cricket, where can I find a tumbler of
          milk for my poor papa?"</p>

     <p>"Three fields off from here there lives a gardener called
          Giangio, who keeps cows. Go to him and you will get the
          milk you are in want of."</p>

     <p>Pinocchio ran all the way to Giangio's house, and the
          gardener asked him:</p>

     <p>"How much milk do you want?"</p>

     <p>"I want a tumblerful."</p>

     <p>"A tumbler of milk costs five cents. Begin by giving
          me the five cents."</p>

     <p>"I have not even one cent," replied Pinocchio, grieved and
          mortified.</p>

     <p>"That is bad, puppet," answered the gardener. "If you
          have not even one cent, I have not even a drop of milk."</p>

     <p>"I must have patience!" said Pinocchio, and he turned
          to go.</p>

     <p>"Wait a little," said Giangio. "We can come to an arrangement
          together. Will you undertake to turn the pumping
          machine?"</p>

     <p>"What is the pumping machine?"</p>

     <p>"It is a wooden pole which serves to draw up the water
          from the cistern to water the vegetables."</p>

     <p>"You can try me."</p>

     <p>"Well, then, if you will draw a hundred buckets of water,
          I will give you in compensation a tumbler of milk."</p>

     <p>"It is a bargain."</p>

     <p>Giangio then led Pinocchio to the kitchen garden and
          taught him how to turn the pumping machine. Pinocchio
          immediately began to work; but before he had drawn up the
          hundred buckets of water the perspiration was pouring from
          his head to his feet. Never before had he undergone such
          fatigue.</p>

     <p>"Up till now," said the gardener, "the labor of turning
          the pumping machine was performed by my little donkey, but
          the poor animal is dying."</p>

     <p>"Will you take me to see him?" said Pinocchio.</p>

     <p>"Willingly."</p>

     <p>When Pinocchio went into the stable he saw a beautiful
          little donkey stretched on the straw, worn out from hunger
          and overwork. After looking at him earnestly, he said to
          himself, much troubled:</p>

     <p>"I am sure I know this little donkey! His face is not
          new to me."</p>

     <p>And, bending over him, he asked him in asinine language:</p>

     <p>"Who are you?"</p>

     <p>At this question the little donkey opened his dying eyes,
          and answered in broken words in the same language:</p>

     <p>"I am&mdash;Can&mdash;dle&mdash;wick."</p>

     <p>And, having again closed his eyes, he expired.</p>

     <p>"Oh, poor Candlewick!" said Pinocchio in a low voice;
          and, taking a handful of straw, he dried a tear that was rolling
          down his face.</p>

     <p>"Do you grieve for a donkey that cost you nothing?" said
          the gardener. "What must it be to me, who bought him for
          ready money?"</p>

     <p>"I must tell you&mdash;he was my friend!"</p>

     <p>"Your friend?"</p>

     <p>"One of my school-fellows!"</p>

     <p>"How?" shouted Giangio, laughing loudly. "How? had
          you donkeys for school-fellows? I can imagine what wonderful
          studies you must have made!"</p>

     <p>The puppet, who felt much mortified at these words, did
          not answer; but, taking his tumbler of milk, still quite warm,
          he returned to the hut.</p>

     <p>And from that day for more than five months he continued
          to get up at daybreak every morning to go and turn the
          pumping machine, to earn the tumbler of milk that was of
          such benefit to his father in his bad state of health. Nor was
          he satisfied with this; for, during the time that he had over,
          he learned to make hampers and baskets of rushes, and with
          the money he obtained by selling them he was able with great
          economy to provide for all the daily expenses. Amongst other
          things he constructed an elegant little wheel-chair, in which
          he could take his father out on fine days to breathe a mouthful
          of fresh air.</p>

     <p>By his industry, ingenuity and his anxiety to work and
          to overcome difficulties, he not only succeeded in maintaining
          his father, who continued infirm, in comfort, but he also contrived
          to put aside five dollars to buy himself a new coat.</p>

     <p>One morning he said to his father:</p>

     <p>"I am going to the neighboring market to buy myself a
          jacket, a cap, and a pair of shoes. When I return," he added,
          laughing, "I shall be so well dressed that you will take me
          for a fine gentleman."</p>

     <p>And, leaving the house, he began to run merrily and
          happily along. All at once he heard himself called by name
          and, turning around, he saw a big Snail crawling out from
          the hedge.</p>

     <p>"Do you not know me?" asked the Snail.</p>

     <p>"It seems to me&mdash;and yet I am not sure&mdash;"</p>

     <p>"Do you not remember the Snail who was lady's-maid to
          the Fairy with blue hair? Do you not remember the time
          when I came downstairs to let you in, and you were caught
          by your foot, which you had stuck through the house-door?"</p>

     <p>"I remember it all" shouted Pinocchio. "Tell me quickly,
          my beautiful little Snail, where have you left my good Fairy?
          What is she doing? Has she forgiven me? Does she still remember
          me? Does she still wish me well? Is she far from here? Can
          I go and see her?"</p>

     <p>To all these rapid, breathless questions the Snail replied in
          her usual phlegmatic manner:</p>

     <p>"My dear Pinocchio, the poor Fairy is lying in bed at the
          hospital!"</p>

     <p>"At the hospital?"</p>

     <p>"It is only too true. Overtaken by a thousand misfortunes,
          she has fallen seriously ill, and she has not even enough
          to buy herself a mouthful of bread."</p>

     <p>"Is it really so? Oh, what sorrow you have given me!
          Oh, poor Fairy! Poor Fairy! Poor Fairy! If I had a million
          I would run and carry it to her, but I have only five dollars.
          Here they are&mdash;I was going to buy a new coat. Take them,
          Snail, and carry them at once to my good Fairy."</p>

     <p>"And your new coat?"</p>

     <p>"What matters my new coat? I would sell even these
          rags that I have on to be able to help her. Go, Snail, and
          be quick; and in two days return to this place, for I hope I
          shall then be able to give you some more money. Up to this
          time I have worked to maintain my papa; from today I will
          work five hours more that I may also maintain my good
          mamma. Good-bye, Snail, I shall expect you in two days."</p>

     <p>The Snail, contrary to her usual habits, began to run like
          a lizard in a hot August sun.</p>

     <p>That evening Pinocchio, instead of going to bed at ten
          o'clock, sat up till midnight had struck; and instead of making
          eight baskets of rushes he made sixteen.</p>

     <p>Then he went to bed and fell asleep. And whilst he
          slept he thought that he saw the Fairy, smiling and beautiful,
          who, after having kissed him, said to him:</p>

     <p>"Well done, Pinocchio! To reward you for your good
          heart I will forgive you for all that is past. Boys who minister
          tenderly to their parents and assist them in their misery and
          infirmities, are deserving of great praise and affection, even if
          they cannot be cited as examples of obedience and good behavior.
          Try and do better in the future and you will be happy."</p>

     <p>At this moment his dream ended and Pinocchio opened
          his eyes and awoke.</p>

     <p>But imagine his astonishment when upon awakening he
          discovered that he was no longer a wooden puppet, but that
          he had become instead a boy, like all other boys. He gave a
          glance round and saw that the straw walls of the hut had
          disappeared, and that he was in a pretty little room furnished
          and arranged with a simplicity that was almost elegance. Jumping
          out of bed he found a new suit of clothes ready for him,
          a new cap, and a pair of new boots, that fitted him beautifully.</p>

     <p>He was hardly dressed when he naturally put his hands
          in his pockets and pulled out a little ivory purse on which
          these words were written: "The Fairy with blue hair returns
          the five dollars to her dear Pinocchio, and thanks him for his
          good heart." He opened the purse and instead of five dollars
          he saw fifty shining gold pieces fresh from the mint.</p>

     <p>He then went and looked at himself in the glass, and he
          thought he was some one else. For he no longer saw the
          usual reflection of a wooden puppet; he was greeted instead
          by the image of a bright, intelligent boy with chestnut hair,
          blue eyes, and looking as happy and joyful as if it were the
          Easter holidays.</p>

     <p>In the midst of all these wonders succeeding each other,
          Pinocchio felt quite bewildered, and he could not tell if he
          was really awake or if he was dreaming with his eyes open.</p>

     <p>"Where can my papa be?" he exclaimed suddenly, and,
          going into the next room, he found old Geppetto quite well,
          lively, and in good humor, just as he had been formerly. He
          had already resumed his trade of wood-carving, and he was
          designing a rich and beautiful frame of leaves, flowers and
          the heads of animals.</p>

     <p>"Satisfy my curiosity, dear papa," said Pinocchio, throwing
          his arms around his neck and covering him with kisses;
          "how can this sudden change be accounted for?"</p>

     <p>"This sudden change in our home is all your doing," answered
          Geppetto.</p>

     <p>"How my doing?"</p>

     <p>"Because when boys who have behaved badly turn over
          a new leaf and become good, they have the power of bringing
          contentment and happiness to their families."</p>

     <p>"And where has the old wooden Pinocchio hidden himself?"</p>

     <p>"There he is," answered Geppetto, and he pointed to a
          big puppet leaning against a chair, with its head on one side,
          its arms dangling, and its legs so crossed and bent that it was
          really a miracle that it remained standing.</p>

     <p>Pinocchio turned and looked at it; and, after he had
          looked at it for a short time, he said to himself with great
          complacency:</p>

     <p>"How ridiculous I was when I was a puppet! And how
          glad I am that I have become a well-behaved little boy!"</p>
